<tr><td valign=top>Magneto carries the team, flying behind Pulse.<br><br>Pulse: There it is, father. We're landing now.<br><br>Magneto: Very well.<br><br>Pulse and Magneto land in front of Zero House.<br><br>Magneto: Should I open the door, Michael?<br><br>Pulse: Allow me.<br><br>Pulse points his index finger towards the door. With one shot, blows the door and part of the front wall into pieces.<br><br>Magneto: I guess that works too.<br><br>Pulse: The door only works for Faction Zero's entrance and exit. My handprint was also accessible, but they may have removed it in thought that I'm dead.<br><br>The team walks into the building. Trails of blood and severed body parts are all over the floor and walls.<br><br>Rocksteady: Who would do such a thing, Mr. Governor?<br><br>Pulse: The ones that think I'm dead wanted to eliminate all witnesses. A group of honorable warriors and friends. All dead. Rocksteady and Punisher, come with me. Nightcrawler and Magneto, follow Chimera around.<br><br>Rocksteady and the Punisher followed Pulse into the West wing of the building. More blood, bones and body parts. Pulse starts to hear whispering coming from the other end of the hall.<br><br>Pulse: (whispering) Come with me.<br><br>They enter another room undetected, and see a couple of shadows talking to each other.<br><br>Shadow #1: Pyre, I want my cash for this now!<br><br>Pyre: Easy, easy. Just because they call you the Taskmaster, doesn't mean you'll beat me. Here's your money.<br><br>Taskmaster: My master will be happy with your compliance.<br><br>Pulse: (from behind) And who might your master be, Taskmaster?<br><br>Taskmaster: Well well, Governor Michael Howlett. Pleasant to see you.<br><br>Pulse: You won't be saying that in six seconds.<br><br>Taskmaster: Oh really? <br><br>Taskmaster pressed a few buttons on his arm compartment. We hear loud thumping and the ground starts to really shake. A giant fist smashes through the wall. It's a Sentinel. And there are about seventy more behind him.<br><br>Pulse: Oh great. This ought to be fun.<br><br>Taskmaster: See you all later.<br><br>Taskmaster escapes through the hole in the wall and is out of sight in less that three seconds. He may have teleported.<br><br>Sentinel: <B>FREEZE MUTANTS</B><br><br>Punisher: Shit. I ain't a mutant. What do they want me for?<br><br>Pulse: It's the only threat they're programmed to use. They're not just mutant killers anymore. Alot of companies, governments and terrorists use them now.<br><br>To Be Continued later...

<tr><td valign=top>Sentinels surround the Punisher. As one reaches towards him to grab, Punisher pulls out two uzis and doesn't take the time to aim. He lines up and fires. He dumps two full clips into the Sentinel's motherboard, frying it instantly.<br><br>Punisher: TIMBERRRRRRRRRRRRRR!<br><br>The Sentinel, while falling, takes out another on it's way down, causing both to explode.<br><br>Rocksteady: There's too m-m-many of them!<br><br>Pulse: Nowhere near, buddy!<br><br>Pulse takes to the air.<br><br>Pulse: Little trick my father taught me!<br><br>Pulse curls himself into a semi-ball, collecting energy. When he finally reaches a point, He lets it ALL go. A giant blast of energy takes out seven Sentinels. He remains in the air, picking off Sentinel by Sentinel.<br><br>Rocksteady: I g-g-got this one!<br><br>Rochsteady picks up a giant robot by the leg and throws it through Zero House.<br><br><br>

<tr><td valign=top>Pulse is in the air, picking off Sentinels one by one. There's one sneaking up behind him in the air.<br><br>Sentinel: <B><I><U>FREEZE MUTANT</U></I></B><br><br>Pulse: Sure. Fat Chance.<br><br>Pulse spins around and tears him to shrapnel with energy blasts.<br><br>Punisher: I need to get back to New York.<br><br>Punisher pulls out a couple of remote controlled bombs and sticks them onto the feet of about ten Sentinels. He runs off in a hurry, and detonates the bombs, destroying all ten. There are about twenty-five left.<br><br>Rocksteady: S-s-still alot left, Mr. Governor.<br><br>Pulse: We've taken out almost fifty.<br><br>Wolverine climbs up the back of one using his claws. He cuts the robots head off, and jumps to another, doing the same.<br><br>Wolverine: Magnus! Help out the team!<br><br>Magneto: I cannot! These are non-ferrous metals plated over plastic and ceramic bodies! My powers can't stop them.<br><br>Magneto then sees a bucket of nails. He lifts the nails and throws them at the face of a Sentinel, causing a short circuit. He begins looking for more metal objects to throw. He sees Wolverine chopping at ankles.<br><br>Magneto: Let me give you a hand.<br><br>Magneto lifts Wolverine and puts his arms out sideways. He spins him at about a hundred miles per hour. He throws the spinning Canadian at every Sentinel in the area until there's only one left.<br><br>Pulse: I'll do the honors! Hey Sentinel!<br><br>The Sentinel looks up at Pulse. Pulse has a ball of energy about one mile in diameter.<br><br>Pulse: WELCOME TO OBLIVION!!!<br><br>Pulse fires the energy blast, completely dissintegrating the Sentinel and causing a huge explosion.<br><br>Pulse: (breathing heavy) I guess I can order the convicts to clean this up as daily community service.<br><br>Punisher laughs as they go back into the building.

<tr><td valign=top>Chimera is about to follow everyone inside when he sees something out of the corner of his eye.  He turns to see what it is and damn near wets himself.  A new model of Sentinel and there are 3 times as many of them as there were in the previous wave.<br><br>Chimera:  Uh Mike.<br><br>Pulse:  What is Chimera.<br><br>Chimera:  Look.<br><br>Pulse:  Shit those are Sinisters model Sentinel.  Looks like we got some more work to do.<br><br>Chimera:  No.  You have business to attend to.  I'll take care of them.<br><br>Pulse:  You can't handle then you have never faced them before you have no idea what they are capable of.<br><br>Chimera:  Well then I will give them everything I have too and thin their numbers as best i can to buy you enough time to get done what needs to be done. By the way when you are finished get your ass back out here to save me.<br><br>Pulse:  Chime.<br><br>Chimera:  GO!!!!<br><br>The others run inside and Chimera turns to face the wave that is incoming.  His left eye glows black followed by his right his whole head follows and the light begins to emenate from every pore.  A massive flash emanates from his body and he stops glowing.  He falls to his knees and then onto his face passed out.<br><br>The Sentinel on point lands right in front of Chimera's body.<br><br>Sentinel:  Mastermold we have an unconious mutant ready to be brought in.<br><br>At that moment the sky for miles turns as black as obsidian.  The darkness is only interupted by the occasional burst of orange light.  Even the lead Sentinel notices that this is out of the ordinary and he looks skyward.  Its the last thing his sensors ever read because a nanosecond later he has is reduced to nothing more than a smoldering pile of ash.  The reamaing Sentinels also look skyward and if they had emotions they would have been terrified.  Out of the sky came 125  75 foot long dragons all jet black except for the eyes which are blood red.  The sky lights up and for the next minute and a half the sky is littered with Dragon bodies and Sentinel parts.  The Dragons were victorius losing only a few in their ranks.  30 seconds after the last Sentinel falls the dragons fade into nothingness.  Its good that they defeated them so quickly because they would have faded after two minutes victory or not.  That is the price of Chimeras power the more powerful the illusion the less time it will last.  That one was the most powerful one he ever created.  He didn't even expect it to last that long or to take them all out but fortunately it did.  The guys inside had better hope that there isn't a third wave.

Anger turns his eyes blood red and he gets in the mutant's face with his hand very tight around his throat.<br><br>Pulse: I have some very good questions, and you'd better have some very good answers.<br><br>Mutant: Don't hurt me, Governor Howlett!<br><br>Pulse: First question, where is the Taskmaster?<br><br>Mutant: He went back to his base in Africa!<br><br>Pulse: Where in Africa?<br><br>Mutant: Zambia!<br><br>Pulse: Next question: Who tried to kill me?<br><br>Mutant: It was a conspiracy! Faction Zero made the attempt as a group. They work for a mutant terrorist in America!<br><br>Pulse: Where? <br><br>Mutant: Colorado! I swear I don't know the name! Don't hurt me!<br><br>Pulse drops the mutant and signals the team to come with him. The mutant begins to glow. Before he can attack, Pulse spins around and blasts holes into the mutant and throws him out the window right in front of Chimera. They walk out to him<br><br>Pulse: Ready to go, Chime?<br><br>Chimera: Where to?<br><br>Pulse: Zambia, Africa. 
<br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Geroge Washington's brother was the Uncle of Our Country<br><br>A 7-day waiting period for purchasing a handgun is stupid. It just gives the buyer more time to think of people he'd like to kill. Now, instead of a single murder, you've got a multiple homicide on your hands.<br><br>Think for a moment about flamethrowers. The fact that we have them at all. What it indicates to me is that at some point, some person said to himself, "Look at all those people across the road. What I wouldn't give to set them on fire. But I'm much too far away. If only I had some devise that would shoot flames at them."<br><br>I don't make enemies... I MAKE VICTIMS!
