The Jedi Council
<td align=right>Sat Feb 28, 2004 5:33pm</table>
<tr><td valign=top>The council of the Jedi has been called into session.  There has been a <br>disturbance in the force emanating from the moon of Nar Shadda; deep <br>in Hutt Space.  The fate of the Republic could be at stake.<br><br>As everyone takes their seats, Yoda begins.  “Evil there is on the moon <br>of Nar Shadda,” he says in a grave voice, “investigate this we must, <br>yeees.  But much danger there is.  Only those who volunteer will go <br>along.”  He turns to face the rest of the council and the rest of the Jedi <br>and concludes, “But caution must be warned.  On Nar Shadda, Jedi are <br>revered not.  Hunted you may very well be.”  On these ominous words, <br>the council breaks up.<br>

<tr><td valign=top>Jaskin Delass sat back as Yoda finished his final warning.  He had only <br>been raised to knighthood only a few months ago and had been itching <br>for an assignment.  Unusual for a Gand in his position.  He rehearsed a <br>Jedi relaxation technique and relaxed, feeling the Living Force.<br>He had thought his first would be an easy task; but something just felt <br>right about this.  The Force seemed to call to him.  His three-fingered hand<br>caressed his lightsaber as he came to a decision and acted.<br>He stood and said, "Master Yoda, Jaskin would be greatly honored if he <br>could accompany this mission."  To his great suprise and relief, the Jedi <br>Master nodded his wizen head in agreement.<br>

<tr><td valign=top>The aged Jedi master walked up to Jaskin and he bowed in reverence.  “Master Yoda, Jaskin is honored to be accepted on such a mission as this.  He hopes that he shall not disappoint you.”<br><br>Yoda inclined his head in acknowledgement and said, “A ship, commissioned for you it has been.  Called Star Burner it is, yes.  Also, a smuggler the captain is.”  <br><br>“Master,” Jaskin buzzed, “can we trust such a scoundrel?”<br><br>“Who better,” said another council member, “to smuggle Jedi into a den of thieves than a smuggler?”<br><br>Jaskin bowed in acceptance of the council’s decision, although his trepidation only slightly abated.  He continued in deep conversation until dismissed by the two Jedi masters.<br><br>Jaskin crossed the council room and entered the turbolift and waited as the other members of the team entered the lift.  After everyone was aboard, he reached out with the Force to engage the decent controls.  There was a whoosh as the doors closed and a short pause as the lift descended through the Jedi Complex to the street level.  The party set out on their jouney.<br><br>Trust in the Force, Master Yoda’s last word reverberated in his mind.<br>

<tr><td valign=top>As the turbolift door whooshed open the Jedi, lead by Jaskin, stepped out of the Jedi complex and into the bright Coruscant afternoon.  As the group proceeded down the boulevard, Jaskin began to doubt the validity of his decision.  This felt right, but could he accomplish the task?  Lost in his reveries, Jaskin hardly noticed where he was going.  One of the other Jedi tapped on his shoulder, “Jaskin, it’s this was to the spaceport.”<br><br>Fighting a wave of embarrassment Jaskin tuned and followed the group down a side street.  <br>

<tr><td valign=top>The Jedi reached the landing platform without further incident.  The smuggler's ship, a pristine-looking Sienar PT-65 cruiser, sat with its hatch open -- and the pilot nowhere in sight.<br>"Wait... something isn't right here," Jaskin muttered, reaching out with the Force to try and locate any threats.  Nothing.<br>"Oh, c'mon, Jaskin!" someone near the back said exasperatedly.  "You can be so paranoid at times."<br>Without warning, the pilot, a cheerful-looking Duros, emerged from inside the ship.  "Welcome!" he said, in perfect Basic.  "This is the <I>Infinitum</I>, one of the fastest ships in the galaxy.  In her, you should make it to Nar Shaada within -- oh, two standard days, at most."<br>Jaskin shook the Duros's hand, then followed the invitation to board the ship.  Something was still tickling his mind, and the tickle was growing stronger by the minute.<br>As he strapped himself in, Jaskin glanced around inconspicuously at the others.  No one showed any signs of fear or stress -- but then, Jedi were usually experts at hiding that sort of thing.  Realizing the futility of sensing their emotions, Jaskin mulled over his thoughts.  The Duros had seemed -- too friendly, but too blunt.  His ship didn't indicate that of a smuggler... rather, it reminded Jaskin of a bounty hunter's ship.<br>Still considering these happy thoughts, Jaskin almost didn't feel the jolt from liftoff and the slightly harder one as the ship obtained hyperspeed.  There was a soft footstep at the door to the passenger cabin, and the Duros driver stepped in.<br>"We have made the jump to lightspeed."  No kidding.  "Feel free to explore... the passenger cabin.  You shall be staying here for some time.  I suggest you make yourselves comfortable.  Good bye, cursed Jedi."  And with that, he stepped out of the room and pressed a bright red button, then the door-close button.<br>Half the Jedi stared, dumbfounded, at the door.  The other half --<br>"Listen," Jaskin said, referring to a quiet hissing sound.  Everyone silenced, heard the noise, and veritably panicked.<br>The hiss was the sound of atmosphere being pulled out of the room.<br>Quite rapidly, at that.<br><br>

<tr><td valign=top>Jaskin disengaged his crash restraint and hopped to his feet.  His lightsaber snap-hissed to life, casting a silvery light on his insectoid features.  He took two steps towards the door and swung.  There was an explosion of sparks as he cut through the door control panel.  With a silent hiss it opened to reveal a very shocked looking Duro.<br><br>"He he said you you wouldn't ha have those!" he stammered, looking at the weapon in Jaskin's hands.  The Jedi deactivated the blade and reached out with the Force towards the cockpit.  There was nobody there.  So who was the Duro talking about?  He turned to the captain as the other jedi filed past him out of the cabin.  "Who is responsible for this?" his hand strayed to his lightsaber.<br><br>panic filled the other's red eyes.  He opened his mouth to speak, but befor the Duro could say a word, the ship rocked violently.  The lights flickered and went out, along with the gravity.

<tr><td valign=top>"Oh, great!  Now what?"  Jaskin muttered, grabbing to a bulkhead and propelling himself toward the cockpit.<br>He looked out the viewport and saw three battered-looking ships scattering away from the ship.  "Jaskin thought you said we were in hyperspace," Jaskin said accusingly to the Duro pilot, who had just entered behind him.<br>"I-I don't know, Mr. Jedi, sir!" the pilot babbled, wringing his hands and staring out the main viewport.  The three ships - <I>pirate ships</I>, Jaskin realized suddenly - each had a small gravity-well projector attached to their ventral side.  It looked as if they had arranged themselves in a triangle around the hyperspace vector and activated the devices as the Jedi ship was passing.  Then, they had begun attacking the ship's power cells - and succeeded, at that.  It wouldn't take too long to repair them - Jaskin saw several ways to repair it right in the cockpit - but harder to answer were why had the pirates dragged them out of hyperspace?  And why were they suddenly attacking the Jedi vessel?<br>"Try to hail them," Jaskin ordered.<br>"Yes, sir," the Duro pilot said, drifting to the comm unit.  He activated it and switched to an all-bands frequency, then repeated, in Basic, Durosian, and several other languages Jaskin had not thought Duros physically capable of: "This is the star vessel <I>Infinitum</I>, requesting an explanation for this unprovoked attack on a diplomatic vessel."  There was no response.  The Duro set the comm for repeat mode, sending the message repeatedly with five-second intervals.  Finally, there came a response.<br>"This is the pirate vessel <I>Princess of Doom</I>.  You are under attack because - "  The last part was wiped out by static.<br>"Uh, sorry, didn't catch that.  Will you repeat, please?"  Jaskin asked politely.<br>"You are un-" The whole rest of the transmission was cut off by static again.<br>"Wait," Jaskin said.  "They're dubbing in the static on purpose.  They don't want us to know why we're being attacked - what are you doing?" he asked, referring to the Duros's fiddling with the control board.<br>"Just a second," the pilot muttered, more to himself than otherwise.  He keyed in two more sequences and a large button, and suddenly the power and artificial gravity came back.  The Duro landed catlike on his feet, while the less fortunate Jaskin was dumped on his back.<br>"This may be a diplomatic vessel, but no one attacks the <I>Infinitum</I> and gets away with it.  Go down to the main hold and get in the gunwell.  I'll have it charged in a minute," the Duro ordered.  Sensing it would be better to trust the pilot's judgment for the time being, Jaskin ran as fast as he could to the cargo bay and climbed into the globular gunner's pod.  As he did so, a green light flashed on the control panel, signaling a full charge.  Jaskin settled himself into the padded shock couch and called the Force into him.<br>Much of the  time, Jaskin wasn't even aware that he was firing the turret until he actually had.  The ships had strong shields, but nothing could hold out forever.  As soon as this thought crossed Jaskin's mind, his mind blanked again and a vessel outside became a rapidly expanding cloud of subatomic particles.<br>One of the other ships, one that looked suspiciously like a highly modified Corellian YT-1700 freighter, came close to the cockpit and fired its dual laser cannons.  The shield held, for the moment.  Jaskin targeted him, blacked out his thoughts, and sent the YT-1700 to join its friend.<br>Suddenly, the Duros's voice sounded in his ear: "Get back up here, Jedi.  We're receiving a call from the <I>Princess</I>."<br>Jaskin eagerly jumped out of the cramped pod and went off to the cockpit.  The small room was filled with the sounds of a strained voice begging for mercy.<br>"... <I>Infinitum</I>, this is the <I>Princess</I>, requesting that you quit your gunning!  I am willing to negotiate."<br>Jaskin glanced at the pilot, then swept his hand in a wide arc and sat down in the copilot's chair, inviting the Duro to carry out the terms.<br>"Okay, <I>Princess</I>, first off, why'd you attack us?  Why don't you just try and finish off that transmission from before the battle then?  If you please."<br>Jaskin smirked to himself.  Those were the Duros: cunning, yet painfully polite in any circumstance.

<tr><td valign=top>Jaskin turned back to the Duro, who was watching him curiously.  The captain stared a moment longer, then turned back to his comm board, where the sound of the <I>Princess</I>'s captain was coming again.<br>"...we have been hired by the Hutts to kill all the Jedi aboard -- so if you could just turn them over to us, we'd be most grateful.  Lord Kadja the Hutt would be most displeased if we didn't return --"<br>"<I>What?!</I>" Jaskin yelled at the captain.<br>There was a pause from the other end, as if the captain had momentarily flinched.  "I-I apologize, Mr. Jedi, sir," the man said shakily.  "Please don't run me through with that sword of yours --"<br>"It, for your information, is called a <U>lightsaber</U>," Jaskin growled through gritted teeth.<br>"Y-yes, that.  But anyway, Kadja has commanded that all the Jedi aboard the <I>Infinitum</I> should be killed... please don't ask me why, I wasn't filled in on the details."<br>The Duro captain broke in on the debate, saying, "Look, you can come dock with us.  I can give you three thousand in exchange for not killing -- <I>or taking</I> -- the Jedi.  You will leave every portable weapon aboard your ship in the cockpit, and --"  The Duro broke off as --<br>"What?  I -- oh, <I>aaaaggh</I>--" came a strangled voice from the comm as the <I>Princess</I> abruptly exploded.<br>Jaskin felt a wave of agony and death through the Force.  He immediately began searching the skies for whatever it was that had destroyed it.  He was soon satisfied: a Hutt pleasure yacht was spinning around and angling for a hyperspace jump.  The yacht had come from behind and attacked the temporarily-unshielded freighter.  Apparently, due to the convenient timing of the attack, they had been eavesdropping on the conversation.<br>How very like the Hutts.
