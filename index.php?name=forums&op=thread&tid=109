<tr><td valign=top>Guard 1>  Well, this is where I was told she was gonna be....  but I don't see her anywhere....<br><br>Guard 2> You idiot.  Everyone knows you don't see Angelica unless she wants you to see her....  we'll be lucky if we notice her before she robs us blind if she takes the notion to....  what makes the Cap'n so sure she'd be in this particular bit of woods anyhow?<br><br>Guard 1> This is where he says his sources told him she'd be....<br><br>Guard 3> Great.  We're stuck out here freezing our arses off because some clown the Cap'n knows <I>claims</I> to know one of the most notorious robbers in the city well enough to be able to say for sure that she'll be here tonight.<br><br>*The three guards that are in veiw huddle against a tree, trying to stay out of sight and keeping their voices low...  the tree they cower against is at the edge of a small clearing with monstrously huge trees all around and a scattering of well disguised torch mounts throughout the trees....  there's a cleverly hidden firepit in the center of the clearing that seems not to have seen use in some time, though that may just be some of the technique used to hide it....  a rustle is heard from not too far by, reminding the three guards that they do have back up close at hand, and then a sudden choking sound is heard as one of the hidden guards is abruptly attacked from behind....  the three guards who had been standing in the clearing run towards the dead guard, catching the faintest glimpse of what looks almost like a shadow as it vanishes into the trees...  *<br><br>???>  And what, prey tell, are a bunch of imbeciles such as yourselves doing out here at this time of the night?  Doing a little hunting, perhaps?  Surely you weren't expecting me to be your prey....<br><br>*the guards that had gone running to their fallen comrade find him dead, his throat slit neatly by what seems to have been a dagger...*<br><br>Guard 1>  No, Misstress Angelica...  We weren't hunting you...  We were sent to talk to you...<br><br>"Angelica"> And what could you possibly have to say that would be of any interest to me?<br><br>Guard 1>  We have a job offer for you...<br><br>"Angelica">  A job offer.  How quaint.<br><br>*A vague rustle is heard and one of the guards is knocked flat on his face in the bushes, a tall dark haired woman landing about five feet in front of the guards, dressed in solid black silk from her toes to her neck.  Her hair is pulled into a tight ponytail, effectively removing it from her face, and her eyes flash a dangerous green in the vague light of the three quarter moon.*<br><br>"Angelica"> And what's to keep me from killing you right now for invading my circle?  Everyone knows damned well the legends that surround this place.  "Anyone who strays into the black oak grove by night will ne'er see day again."  There's a reason for those legends and you're looking at her.<br><br>Guard 2> Please, Misstress, we didn't mean to offend you.  We were sent here by the king to offer you a job, misstress, a good paying job.  <br><br>"Angelica"> The king is the bastard that payed the betrayers who signed my family's death warrant.  My price will not be a low one.  And even that is only if I happen to be feeling cooperative.<br><br>*The third guard, who'd been hanging towards the back of the trio, gives a barely perceptible twitch of his hand and Katrice immediately finds herself under attack by ten guards...  snarling, she kicks one of them hard across the chest, the blades on her boot's heel laying his flesh open to the bone...  then she jumps into the trees, vanishing from sight....  The group of guards spread out, looking for her, and Katrice slinks through the tree limbs until she finds a guard cornered and alone....*

<tr><td valign=top>Midnight: This Khajiit has no words for you human.  You are not welcome here.<br><br>Man:  I thought all who come to Meenwhyl are welcome.<br><br>Midnight:  Normally that is true however you need neither food nor shelter you represent the king and we at the temple are not great lovers of his majesty.<br><br>Midnight heard a rusltle in a nearby tree.  He knew the man was there before the rustle but he thought it careless of him to make so much noise.  In fact he knew that apart from this man there were 10 others nearby.  While he knew they were there and that they were all armed and at the ready he did not yet know their agenda.  Besides that a monk of Meenwhyl would only attack in self defense he would never make the first move.  One thing he was sure of was that they were afraid and that their fear was far more dangerous than any weapon they happened to carry. <br><br>Man:  The king is in need of your assistance.<br><br>Midnight:  And why would I wish to assist him.<br><br>Man:  Because he is your king and we know that you would want to make his leige happy.<br><br>Midnight:  I have just finished telling you I have no desire to make him happy.  Once again I ask you to please leave.<br><br>Man:  Well if that does not please you then perhaps the thought of a massive amount of gold will.<br><br>Midnight:  I have no need of Material possesions Terra in all her wisdom gives me all that I need.<br><br>Man:  Well what if I said you had no choice.  You will be killed if you not cooperate.<br><br>The man in the tree begins to tremble Midnight can hear the crossbow rattling in his hand he knows that it will be only moments before the bolt will come flying at him.<br><br>Midnight:  My answer is still no.<br><br>The man guestures at the tree and for midnight time seems to slow down.  He hears the the trigger pulled, the string hum as it pushes the bolt forward, the clang of the string as it bounces back into its resting position, the whir of the bolt as it cuts through the air.  He moves in what to the casual observer looks like a blur.  In a single gesture he catches the arrow inches from his face spins around and buries it into the man's shin.<br><br>Midnight walks over to the man who is clutching the bolt and making gutteral grunting noises.<br><br>Midnight:  You have escaped with your life.  Leave now and the other 10 shall...<br><br>Midnight drops to one knee and bows his head he appears to be listening intently for a few moments.<br><br>Midnight:  The goddess Terra has commanded me to aid you.  She said that physical rewards are not the only payment I can recieve.

<tr><td valign=top>*Another guard comes running up to the temple, clutching a bloody gash across his chest and panting heavily in a combination of fear, pain, and exertion....  he comes to a halt, almost collapsing before one of the other guards catches him and steadies him....*<br><br>Guard>  What happened, Jemson?<br><br>Jemson>  Angelica....  the group sent to see her....  she's massacreing us....  already killed four of our boys....  hit me pretty hard....  was going after Peters when I took off to find help.....   a hundred yards north of here......  the Black Oak Grove......<br><br>Guard>  You, Khajit, will you help us with this?  Angelica Robertson is too fast for any human.  We were trying to recruit her, as well, but she hates the king for having killed part of her guild members over twenty years ago.  If you won't help us capture her, at least come with us to meet your new partner.<br><br>*the guards, all but Jameson and the man supporting him, turn to run off through the woods at a trot, heading for the Black Oak Grove....  the slight sounds of combat is heard, followed by a guard's scream, then silence other than the rustling made by the few remaining guards in the area....*<br><br>Guard 2>  Tie her up, boys!!<br><br>Angelica>  The hell you will......<br><br>*Angelica smashes her head back into the groin of the man who's standing behind her, trying to secure her hands, and then she rips free of the few bindings they'd managed to get on her before launching herself at the guard who'd given the order to tie her up.  Her clawed gloves make contact with his face, leaving bloody gashes across his cheek, and then someone manages to get a rop around her from a distance, apparently having tied it in a lasso.  Katrice snarls, spinning and going after the one holding the other end of the lasso.  The blade of her boot connects with the underside of his chin and he falls to his knees, clutching at his throat as he rapidly begins to bleed to death....  Katrice slices the rope off of her arms and jumps back into the tree limbs, moving into the shadows and out of sight as she begins trackign her next target from the safety of the tree limbs....*

<tr><td valign=top>Midnight stood in the center of the small clearing and attempted to sense this "Angelica's" location.  He tapped his senses to the max and all he could get was a vague idea that she was behind him.  Whoever this girl was she was good at what she does.  Midnight knew that if she were to come closer he could pinpoint her but as it stood he did not like the prospect of fighting this woman blind.<br><br>Guard:  Khajiit are you going to help us?<br><br>Midnight:  I think not.  I am very good at what I do.  So is she.  If we were to engage each other in combat one of us would likely get seriously injured.  Possibly both of us, and what use would we be to you then.<br><br>Guard: So you are just going to stand there while she massacres us.<br><br>Midnight:  Looks like.  I have no interest in ending up in a healers hut this day.  I suggest you try talking to her.<br><br>Guard:  Because it worked so well with you.<br><br>Midnight:  Yes you aren't very good with words are you.  I suggest you try though.  I can defend myself against her.  You cannot

<tr><td valign=top>Midnight:  I have two names the first of which is Jareth this name was given to me at birth not by my mother and father but by my owners.  I escaped my owners and eventually got to Meenwhyl where they granted me asylum.  The head monk said that I was as black as midnight so I took the name Midnight the day he passed away.

You can send someone to collect the dead later.<br><br>*she gives the guard a shove and he stumbles forward a few feet before catching his balance and stumbling off through the woods toward the palace, the handful of remaining guards falling into place around them....  as they go, they pass an occasional victum of Katrice's, each one with claw marks all over them and a good show of violent pain before death...*

<tr><td valign=top>Midnight looked at the carnage caused my this small young woman.  He had no love for the king's men but she killed them all without remorse or recompense.  He gently dropped to one knee and whispered a prayer.<br><br>Midnight:  Beloved Gaia take the bodies of these fallen warriors so that they might feed the plants and animals.  May their deaths bless the planet by recontributing to the life cycle.<br><br>He rose and quickly caught up to Angelica and the guard who she would likely also "give to the earth."<br><br>Midnight:  Do you have a tendency to kill everyone you meet.  I only ask if I should sleep with an eye and ear open.

<tr><td valign=top>"Angelica">  If you had taken any part in killing my family or had you attacked me, you'd need to be on your guard.  I really have no tendancies to kill unless someone provokes me.  The king's men murdered my family, and so I tend to hold that against them, as well as against the king.<br><br>Guard>  Those crooks weren't your family.  You should've hung with 'em.  The Thieves Guild you were part of deserved what they got.<br><br>*Katrice snarls and lashes out, her hand clenching around the guard's throat and the tiny claws on her fingertips drawing blood from the punctures they make in his skin again....  she presses her grip tighter, watching as his face begins to turn ashen*<br><br>"Angelica"> One more word about them not being my family or deserving to be tortured and killed, and I will see to it that you're screaming and begging for death for weeks before I rip your lungs out and stuff them down your still living throat.<br><br>*she flings him to the ground to clutch his throat in pain and then she kicks him in the thigh with the unspiked toe of her boot.*<br><br>"Angelica">  Get up and get moving.
