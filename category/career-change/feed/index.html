				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Talent is the light for the World, the onus is on torchbearer.”</p>
<p>People Management is one thing that intrigues a lot of us, but Micky Chopra is the right person if you really want to understand the nuances of this skill. He has built a career in Human Resource management but this was not his natural instinct when he was in his college.</p>
<p>Micky started his professional career with Indian Navy Services, after completing his MCA from Galgotia College (Lucknow University). The technical knowledge he received in the college came in handy for understanding client requirements and this helped him move to FCS Software. While working as the resource manager at FCS, he was able to understand how it is important to be able to manage people to improve processes.</p>
<p>The journey towards Human Resource was a slow and steady transformation, where he with his goal oriented focus was able to carve his way to becoming a talent specialist. His first break in Talent management was with SAVY Infotech as the Country Manager in Talent Acquisition and Client Delivery.  Talent Acquisition was an exciting domain for him but his desire to dwell deeper into the realms of people management made him see beyond talent acquisition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_115" style="width: 698px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/micky-chopra-at-IIM-Raipur.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-115" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/micky-chopra-at-IIM-Raipur.jpg" alt="Micky Chopra at Raipur IIM " width="698" height="400" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Micky Chopra is an active speaker for tech in HR.</figcaption></figure>
<p>For last three years, he working with OSS cube and then Taction Software LLC has taken a strategic role, where he understand that talent acquisition is just the start of the cycle and you need to look deeper to sustain the bottom line. He acknowledges how retention and talent engagement can lead to a sustained growth of an organisation.  He approaches human resources in a very technical way and attributes his success to his technical understanding, which has helped him build his career.</p>
<p>The way HR has changed with time is phenomenal,   from being a backend role it has today become a strategy based position with multiple elements like talent branding, talent satisfaction, talent performance and business acquisition through talent being the key matrices today. As Taction Software deals in Niche Technologies, the task becomes more challenging and Talent Branding plays a very important role in acquiring the right talent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-114" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg" alt="Hr Tech Influence award" width="1024" height="682" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Micky is among-st the top 50 HR Tech Influencers</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest motivators for Micky have been his family who supported this tough decision of moving from the more lucrative technology domain to people management.  Today, he is amongst the top 50 HR Technical leaders in the country and a very active speaker about technology in HR. He also promotes sports in his work sphere and at Oss cube was the president of the sports initiative and helped build a culture for sports. This he adds also helps build better work ethics.</p>
<p>“The intent of Rolepost is great, and will help bring the community together and this will be also a great way to appreciate the real talent”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foundation of what you will be is marked in your childhood.  Having her roots in Uttaranchal, Ruchi Pant did most o her schooling from Meerut. But thanks to her father’s transferable job she had to relocate across the country and living in multiple cities made her curious about culture and people.</p>
<p>She was a keen observer and soaked in the wisdom from the diverse experiences in her childhood. After her schooling, she did her graduation in Hospitality Management from IHM, Jaipur.  She was amongst the brightest students but she recalls herself being shy and being uncomfortable in front of new people when she started her career.</p>
<p>Well, if someone meets her now she will come across as the most pleasing personality but she says that sales industry brought about this change in her. Soon after graduation, as she joined as a sales coordinator in the hotel in Mumbai, she started interacting with a lot of people and also started building an ability to understand them. This made her very confident and she started liking interacting with anyone without any jitters.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When you fight your fundamental challenges, you get to a new level” exclaims Ruchi.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early days of her work, she built in a habit of overachieving. This used to always challenge herself and try and exceed the set target. In the beginning as a sales coordinator, she was mostly taking care of passive sales for banquet enquiries. She was looking for a more challenging work and she started working in room sales which are primarily active sales. This made her learn to identify the market, then create a need for her product and finally convert into sales.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in every assignment, she moved from low engagement products like room to selling aircraft which would make her convince the other side of the spectrum i.e. big business owners, decision makers. She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business with the biggest of dignitaries, Businessmen or even Honchos of top companies. The granularity of decision making involved and the process of conversion has always excited her.</p>
<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-87" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg" alt="Ruchi has extablished business relationships with top executives across industries" width="960" height="637" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ruchi Pant with Vijay Mallaya</figcaption></figure>
<p>After working the luxury segment for more than 8 years, she wanted a new challenge. This time was to complete the diverse cycle of sales. In 2013, she started working at pathways and she realised a new dimension to sales.  This time, it was not just about convincing one party to buy a product or service, it was about making a two-way connect.</p>
<p>Pathways follow a pattern of experimental learning where children are provided with best tools to shape a great career. The School believes that children learn more from each other than from the formal education. This makes the process very intricate as it’s not just the parents selecting the school but also the school considering them to be a part of pathway family. The process of admission and communication is more counselling than selling and you need to understand the needs of the parents. In this process, you need to be extra sensitive in creating a proposition in which both the parents and the school see a value that will shape a child’s future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Consultation based selling you need to talk less and let others talk“ Ruchi Pant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Journey of Ruchi can inspire every professional in how you can develop into</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting very early as a flight attendant and travelling across the world, has given Priyanka wings to succeed in every assignment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_92" style="width: 400px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-92" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg" alt="Priyanka Bhakoo professional image" width="400" height="400" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Priyanka Bhakoo as a professional at Samhi Group</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our teenage days are full of dreams and in the race of life, we tend to forget them and choose a conventional career path. There are only a few who start living their dreams since their childhood. Priyanka Aggarwal had always imagined herself flying to exotic locations and started working her way towards her dream in her school days.</p>
<p>With her father in the merchant navy, she got fascinated to international travel and understanding different cultures. She started working as a promoter in her school days and after her first year of college at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce; she joined an air hostess training school. Even before her graduation, she was offered a chance to fly with a leading airline. After flying with domestic carriers, she was within 2 years promoted to as an instructor. This was a great learning for Priyanka Aggarwal and also opened a new door of opportunity.</p>
<p>After getting an offer from Charter Airlines, she joined the services and was able to fulfil her childhood dream of flying across the world. In this journey, she had an opportunity to work for dignitaries of highest order, actors, and politicians. The life was not easy as she was travelling for days in continuity, from one continent to another but she enjoyed every bit of her work.</p>
<p>The best thing which she maintained all her life was to stay grounded and learn from every experience.</p>
<p>In 2011, after a 7-year long career as a flight attendant she wanted to explore something new and was tired of the harsh schedule in flying. This meant to explore a completely new territory. She joined the hospitality industry with &#8216;Samhi Group&#8217; and very well adapted to her new role as an Admin Coordinator. She found a great similarity in two industries and soon was offered to join in as Executive Assistant to the MD at Great India Nautanki Company. With the biggest entertainment destination &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221;, Multiple Restaurants and Hotels under their stable, she got exposure to management of these properties. She handled multiple projects like bringing the First Reverse Bungee to India, opening a speciality restaurant in Bangalore and managing the PNL for Kingdom Of Dreams and Galaxy.</p>
<p>With her interest in Sales and Marketing, she joined Zenica Group as an executive assistant to the Sales and Marketing Head. Zenica Group is amongst the biggest dealerships for Porsche and Audi in India and also owns multiple Apple Reseller Stores. Priyanka understood the nuances of the business and how to manage a team to get sustained growth. This experience transformed her as a professional and made her realise the difference she can make to any business.</p>

<p>With a focus to transform the business practices at her previous organisation, she joined &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; again but this time, she was leading alliances. She in this last stint has been able to build the complete hotel division at &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; and is now working to build synergies with Event Management Companies to make KOD, the number one destination for mega events.</p>
<p>Her perseverance and hunger to learn are infectious and we at RolePost wish the best for her future.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A man of few words but with the ability to make the right and the correct decisions, Nishant Mehta is the rising star ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man of few words but with the ability to make the right and the correct decisions, Nishant Mehta is the rising star of a company that manages the visible space of the many contenders on the internet space that run a closed race to secure the top position. Gozoop, the organisation that is into Search Engine Optimisation that helps organisations to increase their visible ratings on search engines like Google, has given the most critical departments Information Technology and SEO to be handled by Nishant. The company has empowered him with making decisions that would course the path for the company.</p>
<p>But everything wasn’t fancy for him from the start. Being a commerce student, it wasn’t easy for him to take a decision to enter into a line totally different from his current degree. But voraciously reading about technology in magazines and newspapers, got him to make a life changing decision of his life.</p>
<p>A risk taker he started his own venture after working for a Customer Relationship Management company that went bankrupt in 6 months. Not losing his wits on losing a job and having acquired enough knowledge, he started IT consultancy that offered SEO services as well. He built it from the scratch, giving 8 years of his hard work and dedication. But like an economic business cycle that gets hit and then grow towards the peak, Nishant’s business got hit because of the recession that hit USA in 2007. His business was routed across the clients in US, UK and Australia, which is why when the markets slowed down at these places, there was a domino chain reaction that ultimately hit his business turnover. Following the repercussions of this economic hit, his clients across the globe had to close down which then led to him shutting down the operations of his own company.</p>
<p>At this point, looking at the depressed macroeconomic conditions, Nishant did not think it was viable for him to come up with another venture of his and so instead he decided to venture into untested waters and hence joined the then fledgling startup Gozoop. Since then it’s been an unstoppable journey for him as he has constantly kept his path focussed and strived hard in every challenge. His dedication to make the company big has earned himself a place that is not easily replaceable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_59" style="width: 617px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG-20151103-WA0003.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-59" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG-20151103-WA0003.jpg" alt="Nishant Mehta smiling " width="617" height="617" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Always smiling through difficulties</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes in life, it is important to take the right decisions and the right risks when the opportunity is standing at the door. Had he not taken the risk of venturing out outside his commerce background, he wouldn’t have got the chance to have his own startup. And even though it failed, it helped him to gain invaluable experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Arts is not what you see, but you make others see” ~ Edgar Degas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote matches best with the view of Subrata Kar, who believes his work is done with autoschediasm . it is constructed in a way to question our thought and our understanding of the world using different colours, shapes and values.</p>
<p><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-45" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20151002_212221_1" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After he received an award &#8221; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EXCELLENCE 2015&#8243;</p>
<p>Subrata has always had an interest and inclination towards drawing and painting, as his father was in the same field. He decided to further pursue his interest. He did his graduation in fine Arts from Delhi College of Arts, Delhi university. He specialized in photography and advertising arts. His first break into the industry was in print at A&amp;M magazine, as a magazine designer in the year 1997. He also worked with Archies for 8 years and later joined 123 greeting as their Creative Head.<br />
It was during this time that he started exploring the internet and soon joined the force. Internet is often called the “Eight continent” because of its huge impact on the world. In the last 20 years, internet use has grown at around 100 times. It also helped in removing barriers across countries. It has caused ease in access to information and content of various kinds and helped in building communication to different nations and even within the same country. He soon unveiled his work online. He was able to showcase his work and capture the European market with the help from his company &#8216;123 greetings&#8217;. He says<br />
“ social media has a freedom to express and should ROI on an immediate basis.”<br />
He now works with Taction software Llc as a manager content and community social media and has previously worked with OSS cube as a part of the creative and social media team. Promoting of art is much expensive offline and it requires more the budget, than through the internet. The content available online is vast and with the help of technology has helped in immediate redemption and thus, a major contributor to increase key performance indicator(KPI). The profits earned by such great artist has also increased over the last decade and is an incentive for more and more such artist. More effort and incentive should be made towards bringing more such talent to the world of internet.</p>
<p>Although, the internet has brought about major positive changes, it definitely has some flaws. As rightly pointed out by Karr, he says, “discipline and construct is missing online” and “everyone without training becomes a designer, there is little margin for error in this field. The basics and logic of an artist be strong. A story should be built with gravity, learning Photoshop is not designing”. There should be greater importance be laid on teaching the youth about how internet effects arts and arts effects the internet.<br />
Apart from being interested in arts, he was also interested in international cinema. He strongly believed that, “when you read about cinema, your perspective of watching cinema changes”. Highly motivated by Robert McKee, a creative writing instructor and he was inspired by his father.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fusion of business with art one of the greatest thing that has happened till date.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.” Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi College of Engineering, was an exceptional student all his life and soon after graduation joined an IT firm working in financial domain. Always focussed on his career he worked with the company for nearly 2 years, but due to the economic slowdown, the work also slowed down and Varun had to be on &#8216;bench&#8217; for some time.  Just at the beginning of his career, he was full of enthusiasm and wanted to make a dent. But, this dampened his ambitions and also gave him time to re-evaluate what he really wants to do.</p>
<p>Being an athlete at the national level in his schooling days, he always wanted to work in sports. Sports did not look like a viable career option and thus like all his peers he also did his engineering, to save guard his career. This discontent from his job made him venture into the field he really wanted and he against all odds he did his masters from Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration &amp; Technology from Geneva.</p>
<p>As he rightly says</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are always getting prepared to can take that Plunge”.</p></blockquote>

<p>He has worked for 5 years in different domains of sports management across Europe. Being a part of the International Olympics Committee was like a childhood dream come true for him. Working as a Project officer at International Olympics Committee, he got exposure to multiple sports and understood the market potential of every sport. With a desire to build a property from the ground up, he joined AIBA (International Boxing Association). Even though he has not boxed ever in his life, he found this challenge extremely interesting and he helped develop boxing in multiple countries.</p>
<p>On asking him about the potential of sports Industry in India, he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Absolutely it is. Sports industry in India has grown exponentially over the last 5-6 years and it has no signs of stopping. There are more and more jobs coming in this space and what is also heartening to see is that people are starting their own ventures in the sports space”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He feels this is the right time to invest in Indian Sports Industry and is keen to work in India in near future.</p>

<blockquote><p>“There is a big event happening in India in 2017 but unfortunately many people don’t know about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And he hopes to be a part of it. Wishing the best to Varun and hoping Indian Sports Industry can boom and many people can get involved in their dream jobs in India.</p>
