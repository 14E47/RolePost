				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Talent is the light for the World, the onus is on torchbearer.”</p>
<p>People Management is one thing that intrigues a lot of us, but Micky Chopra is the right person if you really want to understand the nuances of this skill. He has built a career in Human Resource management but this was not his natural instinct when he was in his college.</p>
<p>Micky started his professional career with Indian Navy Services, after completing his MCA from Galgotia College (Lucknow University). The technical knowledge he received in the college came in handy for understanding client requirements and this helped him move to FCS Software. While working as the resource manager at FCS, he was able to understand how it is important to be able to manage people to improve processes.</p>
<p>The journey towards Human Resource was a slow and steady transformation, where he with his goal oriented focus was able to carve his way to becoming a talent specialist. His first break in Talent management was with SAVY Infotech as the Country Manager in Talent Acquisition and Client Delivery.  Talent Acquisition was an exciting domain for him but his desire to dwell deeper into the realms of people management made him see beyond talent acquisition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_115" style="width: 698px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/micky-chopra-at-IIM-Raipur.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-115" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/micky-chopra-at-IIM-Raipur.jpg" alt="Micky Chopra at Raipur IIM " width="698" height="400" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Micky Chopra is an active speaker for tech in HR.</figcaption></figure>
<p>For last three years, he working with OSS cube and then Taction Software LLC has taken a strategic role, where he understand that talent acquisition is just the start of the cycle and you need to look deeper to sustain the bottom line. He acknowledges how retention and talent engagement can lead to a sustained growth of an organisation.  He approaches human resources in a very technical way and attributes his success to his technical understanding, which has helped him build his career.</p>
<p>The way HR has changed with time is phenomenal,   from being a backend role it has today become a strategy based position with multiple elements like talent branding, talent satisfaction, talent performance and business acquisition through talent being the key matrices today. As Taction Software deals in Niche Technologies, the task becomes more challenging and Talent Branding plays a very important role in acquiring the right talent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-114" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg" alt="Hr Tech Influence award" width="1024" height="682" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Micky is among-st the top 50 HR Tech Influencers</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest motivators for Micky have been his family who supported this tough decision of moving from the more lucrative technology domain to people management.  Today, he is amongst the top 50 HR Technical leaders in the country and a very active speaker about technology in HR. He also promotes sports in his work sphere and at Oss cube was the president of the sports initiative and helped build a culture for sports. This he adds also helps build better work ethics.</p>
<p>“The intent of Rolepost is great, and will help bring the community together and this will be also a great way to appreciate the real talent”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The people who first reach the summit always leave a track for others to follow. Vinay wanted to help people and help every child to fulfil his dream for education. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Your desire to learn can lead you to achieve, what others think is impossible. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Born to farmer family, living in a small village in Madhya Pradesh, Vinay could have never imagined in his childhood that we will in future become an inspiration for many in his village.</p>
<p>Vinay Khare was bought up in a small village Akola in Datiya District. The village had very limited resources and most families were engaged in farming. His primary schooling happened in a school in Akola, but his father used to teach him at home. This helped him prepare for the district level exams and got selected in the District Government School. He had secured 3<sup>rd</sup> rank overall in the Tehsil and was able to fulfil his aspirations for higher education.</p>
<p>The 5km one way walk every day to the school and being a part of new school both made his vision even more focussed on higher education. The biggest challenge he recalls is that children at that time were more afraid of schools and the hard work required he, on the other hand, got motivated by the challenges.</p>
<figure id="attachment_97" style="width: 2048px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-97" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2.jpg" alt="Vinay Khare devotes his time in developing young minds" width="2048" height="1365" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Vinay at a student workshop</figcaption></figure>
<p>After completing the secondary education till the eighth standard, he had to move to the city Datiya for higher education and gave another entrance for “Saraswati Vidya Mandir, Datiya”. He secured his admission in the school and completed his schooling from this school. He was amongst the bright students and was always amongst the top ranking students.</p>
<p>The biggest glitch in his education so far was that he had always been in a Hindi Medium School and now for higher education English was a must. Through the AIEEE entrance examination, he got admission in Bansal College of Engineering, Mandideep (Bhopal), but the first year was very difficult as most of books and literature was in English. He had to struggle for an entire year to understand the language but his focus made him fight all odds and within the next year, he was back as the top scorer. In the Third year, the biggest opportunity came to his college as Infosys had come for placement. Infosys had a very stringent process of recruitment and he went through multiple interview process. He was academically very strong but with limited command on English, he gave his interview in part Hindi and part English.</p>
<p>But language could not stop his dreams from coming true as he got selected to Infosys, being the only student in his college to get a placement with Infosys. This lead to a new life, and he during his Infosys Training excelled in all tests and also enhanced his English in the process.  After getting his job confirmed in Pune, he was highly content with his life and became an inspiration for a lot of youngsters in his village.</p>

<p>The people who first reach the summit always leave a track for others to follow. Vinay wanted to help people and help every child to fulfil his dream for education. With this in his mind, he joined a Non –Profit called <a href="http://www.snehfoundationindia.org/" target="_blank">SNEH Foundation</a>. He got associated in Dec 2011, the major purpose of his involvement was to make parents understand how education can help make kids support families financially and also help create a better live standards for the child. He has in these 4 years of work with SNEH Foundation has changed and impacted 1000+ people lives and will in future help many become like Vinay Khare and help inspire others.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foundation of what you will be is marked in your childhood.  Having her roots in Uttaranchal, Ruchi Pant did most o her schooling from Meerut. But thanks to her father’s transferable job she had to relocate across the country and living in multiple cities made her curious about culture and people.</p>
<p>She was a keen observer and soaked in the wisdom from the diverse experiences in her childhood. After her schooling, she did her graduation in Hospitality Management from IHM, Jaipur.  She was amongst the brightest students but she recalls herself being shy and being uncomfortable in front of new people when she started her career.</p>
<p>Well, if someone meets her now she will come across as the most pleasing personality but she says that sales industry brought about this change in her. Soon after graduation, as she joined as a sales coordinator in the hotel in Mumbai, she started interacting with a lot of people and also started building an ability to understand them. This made her very confident and she started liking interacting with anyone without any jitters.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When you fight your fundamental challenges, you get to a new level” exclaims Ruchi.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early days of her work, she built in a habit of overachieving. This used to always challenge herself and try and exceed the set target. In the beginning as a sales coordinator, she was mostly taking care of passive sales for banquet enquiries. She was looking for a more challenging work and she started working in room sales which are primarily active sales. This made her learn to identify the market, then create a need for her product and finally convert into sales.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in every assignment, she moved from low engagement products like room to selling aircraft which would make her convince the other side of the spectrum i.e. big business owners, decision makers. She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business with the biggest of dignitaries, Businessmen or even Honchos of top companies. The granularity of decision making involved and the process of conversion has always excited her.</p>
<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-87" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg" alt="Ruchi has extablished business relationships with top executives across industries" width="960" height="637" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ruchi Pant with Vijay Mallaya</figcaption></figure>
<p>After working the luxury segment for more than 8 years, she wanted a new challenge. This time was to complete the diverse cycle of sales. In 2013, she started working at pathways and she realised a new dimension to sales.  This time, it was not just about convincing one party to buy a product or service, it was about making a two-way connect.</p>
<p>Pathways follow a pattern of experimental learning where children are provided with best tools to shape a great career. The School believes that children learn more from each other than from the formal education. This makes the process very intricate as it’s not just the parents selecting the school but also the school considering them to be a part of pathway family. The process of admission and communication is more counselling than selling and you need to understand the needs of the parents. In this process, you need to be extra sensitive in creating a proposition in which both the parents and the school see a value that will shape a child’s future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Consultation based selling you need to talk less and let others talk“ Ruchi Pant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Journey of Ruchi can inspire every professional in how you can develop into</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting very early as a flight attendant and travelling across the world, has given Priyanka wings to succeed in every assignment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_92" style="width: 400px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-92" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg" alt="Priyanka Bhakoo professional image" width="400" height="400" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Priyanka Bhakoo as a professional at Samhi Group</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our teenage days are full of dreams and in the race of life, we tend to forget them and choose a conventional career path. There are only a few who start living their dreams since their childhood. Priyanka Aggarwal had always imagined herself flying to exotic locations and started working her way towards her dream in her school days.</p>
<p>With her father in the merchant navy, she got fascinated to international travel and understanding different cultures. She started working as a promoter in her school days and after her first year of college at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce; she joined an air hostess training school. Even before her graduation, she was offered a chance to fly with a leading airline. After flying with domestic carriers, she was within 2 years promoted to as an instructor. This was a great learning for Priyanka Aggarwal and also opened a new door of opportunity.</p>
<p>After getting an offer from Charter Airlines, she joined the services and was able to fulfil her childhood dream of flying across the world. In this journey, she had an opportunity to work for dignitaries of highest order, actors, and politicians. The life was not easy as she was travelling for days in continuity, from one continent to another but she enjoyed every bit of her work.</p>
<p>The best thing which she maintained all her life was to stay grounded and learn from every experience.</p>
<p>In 2011, after a 7-year long career as a flight attendant she wanted to explore something new and was tired of the harsh schedule in flying. This meant to explore a completely new territory. She joined the hospitality industry with &#8216;Samhi Group&#8217; and very well adapted to her new role as an Admin Coordinator. She found a great similarity in two industries and soon was offered to join in as Executive Assistant to the MD at Great India Nautanki Company. With the biggest entertainment destination &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221;, Multiple Restaurants and Hotels under their stable, she got exposure to management of these properties. She handled multiple projects like bringing the First Reverse Bungee to India, opening a speciality restaurant in Bangalore and managing the PNL for Kingdom Of Dreams and Galaxy.</p>
<p>With her interest in Sales and Marketing, she joined Zenica Group as an executive assistant to the Sales and Marketing Head. Zenica Group is amongst the biggest dealerships for Porsche and Audi in India and also owns multiple Apple Reseller Stores. Priyanka understood the nuances of the business and how to manage a team to get sustained growth. This experience transformed her as a professional and made her realise the difference she can make to any business.</p>

<p>With a focus to transform the business practices at her previous organisation, she joined &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; again but this time, she was leading alliances. She in this last stint has been able to build the complete hotel division at &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; and is now working to build synergies with Event Management Companies to make KOD, the number one destination for mega events.</p>
<p>Her perseverance and hunger to learn are infectious and we at RolePost wish the best for her future.</p>

<p>Tony Robbins</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitin Mohan Shandilya has always been an overachiever starting from his school days.

<p>He Was 1 of the 50 delegates chosen to take part in the Panel: &#8220;Winds of Change: Business Leadership in an evolving economy&#8221; , on a fully sponsored trip to Seoul, South Korea at Harvard University. This set up his career in international marketing and after college he joined as a part of the marketing team at Amul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitin has always followed a discipline towards his work and from the office in a distant city of Anand, Gujarat he was able to create a global imprint for AMUL. Today he heads Digital Marketing and is a part of the international business expansion team. He has been in AMUL since the last 4years and has travelled to South East Asian countries to represent his organisation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_70" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nitin-Feature.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-70" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nitin-Feature.jpg" alt="Nitin In Vietnam for AMUL" width="960" height="960" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nitin representing AMUL in Vietnam</figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part about his work is that he is able to contribute to the society with his work. AMUL was established as a cooperative under GCMMF and is based on welfare of villager in Gujarat. More than 70% of the members are small marginal farmer and a sizeable portion of people belonging to the scheduled castes. They are contributor and owners of the Mega brand and Nitin feels humbled to give their work visibility.</p>
<p>We at Rolepost wish him and AMUL to serve our nation and beyond like they have done always.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man of few words but with the ability to make the right and the correct decisions, Nishant Mehta is the rising star of a company that manages the visible space of the many contenders on the internet space that run a closed race to secure the top position. Gozoop, the organisation that is into Search Engine Optimisation that helps organisations to increase their visible ratings on search engines like Google, has given the most critical departments Information Technology and SEO to be handled by Nishant. The company has empowered him with making decisions that would course the path for the company.</p>
<p>But everything wasn’t fancy for him from the start. Being a commerce student, it wasn’t easy for him to take a decision to enter into a line totally different from his current degree. But voraciously reading about technology in magazines and newspapers, got him to make a life changing decision of his life.</p>
<p>A risk taker he started his own venture after working for a Customer Relationship Management company that went bankrupt in 6 months. Not losing his wits on losing a job and having acquired enough knowledge, he started IT consultancy that offered SEO services as well. He built it from the scratch, giving 8 years of his hard work and dedication. But like an economic business cycle that gets hit and then grow towards the peak, Nishant’s business got hit because of the recession that hit USA in 2007. His business was routed across the clients in US, UK and Australia, which is why when the markets slowed down at these places, there was a domino chain reaction that ultimately hit his business turnover. Following the repercussions of this economic hit, his clients across the globe had to close down which then led to him shutting down the operations of his own company.</p>
<p>At this point, looking at the depressed macroeconomic conditions, Nishant did not think it was viable for him to come up with another venture of his and so instead he decided to venture into untested waters and hence joined the then fledgling startup Gozoop. Since then it’s been an unstoppable journey for him as he has constantly kept his path focussed and strived hard in every challenge. His dedication to make the company big has earned himself a place that is not easily replaceable.</p>

<p>Sometimes in life, it is important to take the right decisions and the right risks when the opportunity is standing at the door. Had he not taken the risk of venturing out outside his commerce background, he wouldn’t have got the chance to have his own startup. And even though it failed, it helped him to gain invaluable experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes life accidently gives us the path in the most unexpected ways. Gayathri had never thought that she would realise her love for music while studying something that was nowhere close to this field.</p>
<p>Passionate for physics and maths, she pursued Engineering wanting to delve more into what interests her. With this she also went through a classical training of music out of interest.</p>
<p>She started her career in embedded systems and wanted to pursue more of it by studying ahead and so wanted to go out of India but somehow that did not work out, maybe because there were plans much better for her in the near course of time.</p>
<p>She decided to pursue Marketing and Communications from Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad where while doing the jamming sessions occasionally, she realised that she is an ardent music lover. This is where she met people having versatile interests and met people who used to organise jamming sessions. These sessions revived her interest again and assured her about her decision to continue her career in this path. Having met the right people at MICA brought a transformation that would give her the satisfaction that nothing else ever could. Working in the Advertising field, everyone knows how to understand and respect each other’s thoughts and support, which is why at MICA she got the critical support that she needed the most at that stage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri-Band.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-53" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri-Band.jpg" alt="Gayathri Rehearsing just before performance " width="960" height="640" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gayathri Practicing with her Band</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having a proficient training in classical music gave her an edge over the other novice lads and gave her a chance to venture into something new. She started fusing western and classical music; she also joined Zee Music for Money Company where she got to chance to showcase her talent on TV. This helped her to bond well with her team members as well as got a chance to travel Delhi, Shillong, Mumbai with her team members. Now there was no stopping her. What followed was an act of her dreams infusing motivation in her and making her trot forward to achieve them. She got a chance to perform at HardRock Hyderabad and since then she has always been doing so. She has then performed across Delhi working with three bands. But this doesn’t mean she left working, after MICA she started working as a Brand Associate at ITSA Brand Innovations. As she pursues her career in advertising with ADK Fortune, a WPP group agency, the diverse colleagues inspire her even more. She says &#8221; Advertising has let her keep the creative side alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing comes easy in life and things do become easy when you have the support of your parents. Gayathri was lucky to have a continuous support and blessings from them which in turn encouraged her to follow her dream and never look back. It just helped her to stay put and focus. It gave her the confidence to believe that music is what gives her the eternal satisfaction and makes her life fulfilling. Her dreams don’t stop at performing at bands. She now dreams to do the two things that she likes the most together, travelling and singing together. Her biggest dream till date is to open a Jam Pad with a café.</p>
<figure id="attachment_54" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri-Jam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-54" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri-Jam.jpg" alt="Gayathri part of the Friday Jam" width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gayathri Featured in a popular Daily for her performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>Life is strange in the sense it makes you meet people who give you the slightest push unknowingly for you to achieve your own dreams. Her husband being a DJ has helped to gain many insights into this field and always supported her. They are fun loving duos who enjoy music with every breath of their life. They love their music and also gear up for adventures together, their latest quest being a travel to Ladakh on a bike.</p>
<figure id="attachment_52" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-52" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gayathri.jpg" alt="Gayathri rides with her love of life bike, music and her husband" width="960" height="640" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gayathri on her Bike to pristine backdrops</figcaption></figure>
<p>Her story not only teaches us to stay focused on the work we do but encourages us to pursue our passion with the same zeal. Just working is not important; getting the satisfaction while doing that work is what makes the real difference. It makes us value our life and enjoy it every second.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Arts is not what you see, but you make others see” ~ Edgar Degas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote matches best with the view of Subrata Kar, who believes his work is done with autoschediasm . it is constructed in a way to question our thought and our understanding of the world using different colours, shapes and values.</p>
<p><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-45" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20151002_212221_1" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After he received an award &#8221; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EXCELLENCE 2015&#8243;</p>
<p>Subrata has always had an interest and inclination towards drawing and painting, as his father was in the same field. He decided to further pursue his interest. He did his graduation in fine Arts from Delhi College of Arts, Delhi university. He specialized in photography and advertising arts. His first break into the industry was in print at A&amp;M magazine, as a magazine designer in the year 1997. He also worked with Archies for 8 years and later joined 123 greeting as their Creative Head.<br />
It was during this time that he started exploring the internet and soon joined the force. Internet is often called the “Eight continent” because of its huge impact on the world. In the last 20 years, internet use has grown at around 100 times. It also helped in removing barriers across countries. It has caused ease in access to information and content of various kinds and helped in building communication to different nations and even within the same country. He soon unveiled his work online. He was able to showcase his work and capture the European market with the help from his company &#8216;123 greetings&#8217;. He says<br />
“ social media has a freedom to express and should ROI on an immediate basis.”<br />
He now works with Taction software Llc as a manager content and community social media and has previously worked with OSS cube as a part of the creative and social media team. Promoting of art is much expensive offline and it requires more the budget, than through the internet. The content available online is vast and with the help of technology has helped in immediate redemption and thus, a major contributor to increase key performance indicator(KPI). The profits earned by such great artist has also increased over the last decade and is an incentive for more and more such artist. More effort and incentive should be made towards bringing more such talent to the world of internet.</p>
<p>Although, the internet has brought about major positive changes, it definitely has some flaws. As rightly pointed out by Karr, he says, “discipline and construct is missing online” and “everyone without training becomes a designer, there is little margin for error in this field. The basics and logic of an artist be strong. A story should be built with gravity, learning Photoshop is not designing”. There should be greater importance be laid on teaching the youth about how internet effects arts and arts effects the internet.<br />
Apart from being interested in arts, he was also interested in international cinema. He strongly believed that, “when you read about cinema, your perspective of watching cinema changes”. Highly motivated by Robert McKee, a creative writing instructor and he was inspired by his father.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fusion of business with art one of the greatest thing that has happened till date.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi College of Engineering, was an exceptional student all his life and soon after graduation joined an IT firm working in financial domain. Always focussed on his career he worked with the company for nearly 2 years, but due to the economic slowdown, the work also slowed down and Varun had to be on &#8216;bench&#8217; for some time.  Just at the beginning of his career, he was full of enthusiasm and wanted to make a dent. But, this dampened his ambitions and also gave him time to re-evaluate what he really wants to do.</p>
<p>Being an athlete at the national level in his schooling days, he always wanted to work in sports. Sports did not look like a viable career option and thus like all his peers he also did his engineering, to save guard his career. This discontent from his job made him venture into the field he really wanted and he against all odds he did his masters from Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration &amp; Technology from Geneva.</p>
<p>As he rightly says</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are always getting prepared to can take that Plunge”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was able to convince family and friends and embarked on a journey of sports management.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-34" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg" alt="Varun with the Team " width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Travelling Across Europe</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has worked for 5 years in different domains of sports management across Europe. Being a part of the International Olympics Committee was like a childhood dream come true for him. Working as a Project officer at International Olympics Committee, he got exposure to multiple sports and understood the market potential of every sport. With a desire to build a property from the ground up, he joined AIBA (International Boxing Association). Even though he has not boxed ever in his life, he found this challenge extremely interesting and he helped develop boxing in multiple countries.</p>
<p>On asking him about the potential of sports Industry in India, he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Absolutely it is. Sports industry in India has grown exponentially over the last 5-6 years and it has no signs of stopping. There are more and more jobs coming in this space and what is also heartening to see is that people are starting their own ventures in the sports space”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He feels this is the right time to invest in Indian Sports Industry and is keen to work in India in near future.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36" style="width: 720px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-UEFA.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-36" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-UEFA.jpg" alt="Part of the biggest sporting event UEFA" width="720" height="408" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Varun Ranjan at the UEFA Meet</figcaption></figure>
<p>Varun is looking forward to FIFA U-17 World Cup coming to India and thinks of it as the biggest sporting events to happen in India. He comments</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a big event happening in India in 2017 but unfortunately many people don’t know about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And he hopes to be a part of it. Wishing the best to Varun and hoping Indian Sports Industry can boom and many people can get involved in their dream jobs in India.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, we are going to take a sneak peek at the career journey of Nandini Borkar. Nandini works as an HR professional at GoZoop, Mumbai. GoZoop is a leading digital services and products company.</p>
<p>Nandini’s career journey started when she finished her Masters degree in Chemistry, in 2004. She was a bright and cheerful student since her school days. The first break which Nandini got after her Masters was at a U.K. based call center. She worked in night shifts during that tenure.</p>
<p>Soon after that Nandini got married and left this job, as it was becoming difficult for her to manage shifts after her marriage. She then struggled to get a job as a Career Counselor for some time and then moved towards sales profile for the next three years. She also took a sabbatical during her maternity break.</p>
<p>Once Nandini was ready to face back career challenges, she joined a BPO in training profile as an Associate Trainer. During these days, Nandini had an inclination towards the blooming field of Social media marketing and wanted to try her hands on it. She was also interviewed for marketing profile at GoZoop; the Mumbai-based digital services company, but ended up getting selected for HR profile there.</p>
<p>Human Resources at GoZoop are termed as Happiness officers, and so was Nandini. She has been working as a Happiness officer for the last 2.5 years in the organization. As the name suggests the Happiness officers are responsible for making all employees happy and also to make them stay longer. Nandini has been working hard towards this goal. For her, there is nothing more rewarding than sincerity and hard work, but she also knows how to work smart.</p>
<p>Being the kind of perfectionist Nandini is, she makes sure she handles all the tasks meant for her with great excitement and executes them with great spirits. She is also involved with the learning and development part of the team and the onboarding of employees.</p>
<figure id="attachment_26" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11214071_444786652358943_2954286116733843148_n.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-26" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11214071_444786652358943_2954286116733843148_n.jpg" alt="Gozoop awards with nandini Borkar" width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nandini with the team</figcaption></figure>
<p>As per her hobbies, she likes meeting new people, trying innovations, and traveling. Nandini is also a big time multitasked member of the team. She can handle various responsibilities simultaneously. In spare time, she likes watching movies and tries her hands on origami. On the family front, Nandini is blessed with a cute 7-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Nandini says,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am always open to learn new things. At work, I learn from the upcoming talents, and at home, my daughter is there to teach me new things each day!</p></blockquote>
<p>Nandini is a cheerful bright lady who takes every challenge and opportunity with great stride and also knows how to stay happy, always!</p>
