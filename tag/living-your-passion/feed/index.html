				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes life accidently gives us the path in the most unexpected ways. Gayathri had never thought that she would realise her love for music while studying something that was nowhere close to this field.</p>
<p>Passionate for physics and maths, she pursued Engineering wanting to delve more into what interests her. With this she also went through a classical training of music out of interest.</p>
<p>She started her career in embedded systems and wanted to pursue more of it by studying ahead and so wanted to go out of India but somehow that did not work out, maybe because there were plans much better for her in the near course of time.</p>
<p>She decided to pursue Marketing and Communications from Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad where while doing the jamming sessions occasionally, she realised that she is an ardent music lover. This is where she met people having versatile interests and met people who used to organise jamming sessions. These sessions revived her interest again and assured her about her decision to continue her career in this path. Having met the right people at MICA brought a transformation that would give her the satisfaction that nothing else ever could. Working in the Advertising field, everyone knows how to understand and respect each other’s thoughts and support, which is why at MICA she got the critical support that she needed the most at that stage.</p>

<p>Having a proficient training in classical music gave her an edge over the other novice lads and gave her a chance to venture into something new. She started fusing western and classical music; she also joined Zee Music for Money Company where she got to chance to showcase her talent on TV. This helped her to bond well with her team members as well as got a chance to travel Delhi, Shillong, Mumbai with her team members. Now there was no stopping her. What followed was an act of her dreams infusing motivation in her and making her trot forward to achieve them. She got a chance to perform at HardRock Hyderabad and since then she has always been doing so. She has then performed across Delhi working with three bands. But this doesn’t mean she left working, after MICA she started working as a Brand Associate at ITSA Brand Innovations. As she pursues her career in advertising with ADK Fortune, a WPP group agency, the diverse colleagues inspire her even more. She says &#8221; Advertising has let her keep the creative side alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing comes easy in life and things do become easy when you have the support of your parents. Gayathri was lucky to have a continuous support and blessings from them which in turn encouraged her to follow her dream and never look back. It just helped her to stay put and focus. It gave her the confidence to believe that music is what gives her the eternal satisfaction and makes her life fulfilling. Her dreams don’t stop at performing at bands. She now dreams to do the two things that she likes the most together, travelling and singing together. Her biggest dream till date is to open a Jam Pad with a café.</p>

<p>Life is strange in the sense it makes you meet people who give you the slightest push unknowingly for you to achieve your own dreams. Her husband being a DJ has helped to gain many insights into this field and always supported her. They are fun loving duos who enjoy music with every breath of their life. They love their music and also gear up for adventures together, their latest quest being a travel to Ladakh on a bike.</p>

<p>Her story not only teaches us to stay focused on the work we do but encourages us to pursue our passion with the same zeal. Just working is not important; getting the satisfaction while doing that work is what makes the real difference. It makes us value our life and enjoy it every second.</p>
