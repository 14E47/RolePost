				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man of few words but with the ability to make the right and the correct decisions, Nishant Mehta is the rising star of a company that manages the visible space of the many contenders on the internet space that run a closed race to secure the top position. Gozoop, the organisation that is into Search Engine Optimisation that helps organisations to increase their visible ratings on search engines like Google, has given the most critical departments Information Technology and SEO to be handled by Nishant. The company has empowered him with making decisions that would course the path for the company.</p>
<p>But everything wasn’t fancy for him from the start. Being a commerce student, it wasn’t easy for him to take a decision to enter into a line totally different from his current degree. But voraciously reading about technology in magazines and newspapers, got him to make a life changing decision of his life.</p>
<p>A risk taker he started his own venture after working for a Customer Relationship Management company that went bankrupt in 6 months. Not losing his wits on losing a job and having acquired enough knowledge, he started IT consultancy that offered SEO services as well. He built it from the scratch, giving 8 years of his hard work and dedication. But like an economic business cycle that gets hit and then grow towards the peak, Nishant’s business got hit because of the recession that hit USA in 2007. His business was routed across the clients in US, UK and Australia, which is why when the markets slowed down at these places, there was a domino chain reaction that ultimately hit his business turnover. Following the repercussions of this economic hit, his clients across the globe had to close down which then led to him shutting down the operations of his own company.</p>
<p>At this point, looking at the depressed macroeconomic conditions, Nishant did not think it was viable for him to come up with another venture of his and so instead he decided to venture into untested waters and hence joined the then fledgling startup Gozoop. Since then it’s been an unstoppable journey for him as he has constantly kept his path focussed and strived hard in every challenge. His dedication to make the company big has earned himself a place that is not easily replaceable.</p>

<p>Sometimes in life, it is important to take the right decisions and the right risks when the opportunity is standing at the door. Had he not taken the risk of venturing out outside his commerce background, he wouldn’t have got the chance to have his own startup. And even though it failed, it helped him to gain invaluable experience.</p>
