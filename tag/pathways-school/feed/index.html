				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foundation of what you will be is marked in your childhood.  Having her roots in Uttaranchal, Ruchi Pant did most o her schooling from Meerut. But thanks to her father’s transferable job she had to relocate across the country and living in multiple cities made her curious about culture and people.</p>
<p>She was a keen observer and soaked in the wisdom from the diverse experiences in her childhood. After her schooling, she did her graduation in Hospitality Management from IHM, Jaipur.  She was amongst the brightest students but she recalls herself being shy and being uncomfortable in front of new people when she started her career.</p>
<p>Well, if someone meets her now she will come across as the most pleasing personality but she says that sales industry brought about this change in her. Soon after graduation, as she joined as a sales coordinator in the hotel in Mumbai, she started interacting with a lot of people and also started building an ability to understand them. This made her very confident and she started liking interacting with anyone without any jitters.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When you fight your fundamental challenges, you get to a new level” exclaims Ruchi.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early days of her work, she built in a habit of overachieving. This used to always challenge herself and try and exceed the set target. In the beginning as a sales coordinator, she was mostly taking care of passive sales for banquet enquiries. She was looking for a more challenging work and she started working in room sales which are primarily active sales. This made her learn to identify the market, then create a need for her product and finally convert into sales.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in every assignment, she moved from low engagement products like room to selling aircraft which would make her convince the other side of the spectrum i.e. big business owners, decision makers. She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business with the biggest of dignitaries, Businessmen or even Honchos of top companies. The granularity of decision making involved and the process of conversion has always excited her.</p>

<p>After working the luxury segment for more than 8 years, she wanted a new challenge. This time was to complete the diverse cycle of sales. In 2013, she started working at pathways and she realised a new dimension to sales.  This time, it was not just about convincing one party to buy a product or service, it was about making a two-way connect.</p>
<p>Pathways follow a pattern of experimental learning where children are provided with best tools to shape a great career. The School believes that children learn more from each other than from the formal education. This makes the process very intricate as it’s not just the parents selecting the school but also the school considering them to be a part of pathway family. The process of admission and communication is more counselling than selling and you need to understand the needs of the parents. In this process, you need to be extra sensitive in creating a proposition in which both the parents and the school see a value that will shape a child’s future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Consultation based selling you need to talk less and let others talk“ Ruchi Pant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Journey of Ruchi can inspire every professional in how you can develop into</p>
