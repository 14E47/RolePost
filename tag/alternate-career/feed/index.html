				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Your desire to learn can lead you to achieve, what others think is impossible. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Born to farmer family, living in a small village in Madhya Pradesh, Vinay could have never imagined in his childhood that we will in future become an inspiration for many in his village.</p>
<p>Vinay Khare was bought up in a small village Akola in Datiya District. The village had very limited resources and most families were engaged in farming. His primary schooling happened in a school in Akola, but his father used to teach him at home. This helped him prepare for the district level exams and got selected in the District Government School. He had secured 3<sup>rd</sup> rank overall in the Tehsil and was able to fulfil his aspirations for higher education.</p>
<p>The 5km one way walk every day to the school and being a part of new school both made his vision even more focussed on higher education. The biggest challenge he recalls is that children at that time were more afraid of schools and the hard work required he, on the other hand, got motivated by the challenges.</p>

<p>After completing the secondary education till the eighth standard, he had to move to the city Datiya for higher education and gave another entrance for “Saraswati Vidya Mandir, Datiya”. He secured his admission in the school and completed his schooling from this school. He was amongst the bright students and was always amongst the top ranking students.</p>
<p>The biggest glitch in his education so far was that he had always been in a Hindi Medium School and now for higher education English was a must. Through the AIEEE entrance examination, he got admission in Bansal College of Engineering, Mandideep (Bhopal), but the first year was very difficult as most of books and literature was in English. He had to struggle for an entire year to understand the language but his focus made him fight all odds and within the next year, he was back as the top scorer. In the Third year, the biggest opportunity came to his college as Infosys had come for placement. Infosys had a very stringent process of recruitment and he went through multiple interview process. He was academically very strong but with limited command on English, he gave his interview in part Hindi and part English.</p>
<p>But language could not stop his dreams from coming true as he got selected to Infosys, being the only student in his college to get a placement with Infosys. This lead to a new life, and he during his Infosys Training excelled in all tests and also enhanced his English in the process.  After getting his job confirmed in Pune, he was highly content with his life and became an inspiration for a lot of youngsters in his village.</p>

<p>The people who first reach the summit always leave a track for others to follow. Vinay wanted to help people and help every child to fulfil his dream for education. With this in his mind, he joined a Non –Profit called <a href="http://www.snehfoundationindia.org/" target="_blank">SNEH Foundation</a>. He got associated in Dec 2011, the major purpose of his involvement was to make parents understand how education can help make kids support families financially and also help create a better live standards for the child. He has in these 4 years of work with SNEH Foundation has changed and impacted 1000+ people lives and will in future help many become like Vinay Khare and help inspire others.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.” Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi College of Engineering, was an exceptional student all his life and soon after graduation joined an IT firm working in financial domain. Always focussed on his career he worked with the company for nearly 2 years, but due to the economic slowdown, the work also slowed down and Varun had to be on &#8216;bench&#8217; for some time.  Just at the beginning of his career, he was full of enthusiasm and wanted to make a dent. But, this dampened his ambitions and also gave him time to re-evaluate what he really wants to do.</p>
<p>Being an athlete at the national level in his schooling days, he always wanted to work in sports. Sports did not look like a viable career option and thus like all his peers he also did his engineering, to save guard his career. This discontent from his job made him venture into the field he really wanted and he against all odds he did his masters from Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration &amp; Technology from Geneva.</p>
<p>As he rightly says</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are always getting prepared to can take that Plunge”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was able to convince family and friends and embarked on a journey of sports management.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-34" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg" alt="Varun with the Team " width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Travelling Across Europe</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has worked for 5 years in different domains of sports management across Europe. Being a part of the International Olympics Committee was like a childhood dream come true for him. Working as a Project officer at International Olympics Committee, he got exposure to multiple sports and understood the market potential of every sport. With a desire to build a property from the ground up, he joined AIBA (International Boxing Association). Even though he has not boxed ever in his life, he found this challenge extremely interesting and he helped develop boxing in multiple countries.</p>
<p>On asking him about the potential of sports Industry in India, he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Absolutely it is. Sports industry in India has grown exponentially over the last 5-6 years and it has no signs of stopping. There are more and more jobs coming in this space and what is also heartening to see is that people are starting their own ventures in the sports space”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He feels this is the right time to invest in Indian Sports Industry and is keen to work in India in near future.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36" style="width: 720px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-UEFA.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-36" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-UEFA.jpg" alt="Part of the biggest sporting event UEFA" width="720" height="408" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Varun Ranjan at the UEFA Meet</figcaption></figure>
<p>Varun is looking forward to FIFA U-17 World Cup coming to India and thinks of it as the biggest sporting events to happen in India. He comments</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a big event happening in India in 2017 but unfortunately many people don’t know about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And he hopes to be a part of it. Wishing the best to Varun and hoping Indian Sports Industry can boom and many people can get involved in their dream jobs in India.</p>
