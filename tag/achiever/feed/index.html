<p>Tony Robbins</p>

<p>Nitin Mohan Shandilya has always been an overachiever starting from his school days. He did his schooling from Birla Public School, Pilani, Rajasthan where he excelled academically and was also the school captain for the All India India Public School Conference (I.P.S.C.) Table Tennis Tournament (2002). He won many laurels at school and state level.  After his schooling he pursued engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, Karnatka. He held the position of a captain for the University Table Tennis team.  Leadership was something that came him naturally and he build that in his work.</p>
<p><u><br />
</u>After his engineering he spent three years traveling between three locations: Gurgaon, Bangalore and Boston, USA for his organization Fidelity Investment. He got international exposure and realized the merits of International marketing. With the same focus he joined the PGPCM program in marketing and Communications from MICA (Institute of Strategic Marketing and Communication). A meticulous student, he was amongst the top 5% of the students in first year, as he passed out with an overall CGPA of 3.8/4. He also initiated a new page in MICA, as he became the Co-founder and Head Marketing of TEDxMICA 2010-2012. Having been inspired by TED-Global he conceptualized and organized the first TED conference at his B-schools in the country. To gain exposure of the international market he went for an exchange program to ESCEM, Poitiers France. He also streamed the talks in &#8220;Going Global Conference&#8221; in ESCEM, Poitiers France to enhance the brand equity of MICA on a global scale. Students of 15 nationalities attended the streaming.</p>

<p>He Was 1 of the 50 delegates chosen to take part in the Panel: &#8220;Winds of Change: Business Leadership in an evolving economy&#8221; , on a fully sponsored trip to Seoul, South Korea at Harvard University. This set up his career in international marketing and after college he joined as a part of the marketing team at Amul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitin has always followed a discipline towards his work and from the office in a distant city of Anand, Gujarat he was able to create a global imprint for AMUL. Today he heads Digital Marketing and is a part of the international business expansion team. He has been in AMUL since the last 4years and has travelled to South East Asian countries to represent his organisation.</p>

<p>The best part about his work is that he is able to contribute to the society with his work. AMUL was established as a cooperative under GCMMF and is based on welfare of villager in Gujarat. More than 70% of the members are small marginal farmer and a sizeable portion of people belonging to the scheduled castes. They are contributor and owners of the Mega brand and Nitin feels humbled to give their work visibility.</p>
<p>We at Rolepost wish him and AMUL to serve our nation and beyond like they have done always.</p>
