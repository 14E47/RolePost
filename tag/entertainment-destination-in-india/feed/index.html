				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ayesha </strong>Dahra is one of the well-known names, today, in the entertainment industry. She heads the PR and Corporate Communications at India’s first live entertainment, theater and leisure destination – “Kingdom of Dreams” – in Gurgaon. This story will cover her arduous but remarkable journey of life.</p>
<p>Right since her early days, Ayesha had been a very bright all-rounder.  She had an inclination towards dance, arts, cultural events, debates, elocutions, theater, etc. This passion for arts has been a driving force in her life. Education-wise, she acquired her Masters Degree in English Literature from Agra and won various prizes and laureates to her name. She also gained a certification in garment design.</p>
<p>After getting married, Ayesha faced different liabilities and responsibilities and left her passion for arts and dance. However, she started her own garment business. Things took a bad turn and Ayesha faced a major setback by her broken marriage. She was now a single mother of two little kids. These hardships were not enough when she also saw a downfall in her business because of various issues.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, she entered the corporate world after 15 years of completion of her formal degree. This was quite tough, and the initial years were quite turbulent for her. She faced frequent job changes due to the recession and other reasons.</p>
<p>She initially worked as a writer with various advertising agencies and publishing houses and worked as an editor in YES magazines – one of the lifestyle magazines by VLCC group followed by handling PR and corporate marketing at Satya Paul, in 2002. She then associated with an International brand, TONY&amp;GUY for Brushman India Ltd, but lost her job during the recession.</p>
<p>Ayesha being the kind of fighter she is, fought back until she found out what destiny has in store for her. She got a job with the Luxury Market Council and came back with flying colors.</p>
<p>Destiny smiled at her once again when she rolled on the launch of the biggest entertainment destination of India- “Kingdom of Dreams”. Being one of the founder members of the team, Ayesha now handles the complete marketing vertical for this entertainment wonder. Life has been a roller-coaster ride for Ayesha, but she has never seen back. Her “never say die” spirit has kept her going through the odds of life and made her emerge as a winner.</p>

<p>Having settled career-wise, in 2006, she resumed her passion for dancing by learning “Odissi”. She now is an active propagator of the classical dance form. Her recitals can be viewed live now; the most recent one was on 20<sup>th</sup> October, at Faridabad. On the family front, her kids are all grown up and completing their professional educations from great institutes. Her son, 20, is in Bangalore and her daughter, 17, is studying in London.</p>
<p>Life has been very challenging as well as very giving for Ayesha, but the important point is that she never gave up. She now stands proud and relishes her work as well as her passion.</p>
