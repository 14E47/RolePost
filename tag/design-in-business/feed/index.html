				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Arts is not what you see, but you make others see” ~ Edgar Degas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote matches best with the view of Subrata Kar, who believes his work is done with autoschediasm . it is constructed in a way to question our thought and our understanding of the world using different colours, shapes and values.</p>
<p><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-45" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_20151002_212221_11-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20151002_212221_1" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After he received an award &#8221; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EXCELLENCE 2015&#8243;</p>
<p>Subrata has always had an interest and inclination towards drawing and painting, as his father was in the same field. He decided to further pursue his interest. He did his graduation in fine Arts from Delhi College of Arts, Delhi university. He specialized in photography and advertising arts. His first break into the industry was in print at A&amp;M magazine, as a magazine designer in the year 1997. He also worked with Archies for 8 years and later joined 123 greeting as their Creative Head.<br />
It was during this time that he started exploring the internet and soon joined the force. Internet is often called the “Eight continent” because of its huge impact on the world. In the last 20 years, internet use has grown at around 100 times. It also helped in removing barriers across countries. It has caused ease in access to information and content of various kinds and helped in building communication to different nations and even within the same country. He soon unveiled his work online. He was able to showcase his work and capture the European market with the help from his company &#8216;123 greetings&#8217;. He says<br />
“ social media has a freedom to express and should ROI on an immediate basis.”<br />
He now works with Taction software Llc as a manager content and community social media and has previously worked with OSS cube as a part of the creative and social media team. Promoting of art is much expensive offline and it requires more the budget, than through the internet. The content available online is vast and with the help of technology has helped in immediate redemption and thus, a major contributor to increase key performance indicator(KPI). The profits earned by such great artist has also increased over the last decade and is an incentive for more and more such artist. More effort and incentive should be made towards bringing more such talent to the world of internet.</p>
<p>Although, the internet has brought about major positive changes, it definitely has some flaws. As rightly pointed out by Karr, he says, “discipline and construct is missing online” and “everyone without training becomes a designer, there is little margin for error in this field. The basics and logic of an artist be strong. A story should be built with gravity, learning Photoshop is not designing”. There should be greater importance be laid on teaching the youth about how internet effects arts and arts effects the internet.<br />
Apart from being interested in arts, he was also interested in international cinema. He strongly believed that, “when you read about cinema, your perspective of watching cinema changes”. Highly motivated by Robert McKee, a creative writing instructor and he was inspired by his father.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fusion of business with art one of the greatest thing that has happened till date.</p></blockquote>
