				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like the purity of gold is tested by fire, the purity and nobility in the life of a person are decided by the deeds they do for the betterment of the people around them.</p>
<p>Sometimes the crossroads of decisions lead to the beautiful miracles of life. This is what happened when she took the most important decision of her life that changed her as a person and gave her life a new direction. She is grateful for having them give her such an avid experience of working with professionals from 25 countries and see the South-East Asian component grow in front of her like her own baby and see it creating a humanitarian revolution in the lives of the deserted citizens. It’s not just a job for her, but it is the most important element of her life that makes her feel blessed for making her life change for the good.</p>
<h3>It all started in the eyes of the paradise of the earth.</h3>
<p>In the breathtaking beauty and the serenity, Farhat Mantoo was born in the arms of Kashmir only to be besieged by the harrowing militants and the war zone. But that didn’t stop her from following her passion and she successfully pursued Psychology in Bachelors and communication in her masters. Following her interest in journalism, she went ahead working as a journalist with Agence France-Presse (AFP).  But after a period of 2 years she felt drained with the massive effort it took for her to be in front of the camera.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara3.jpg"><img class="wp-image-13" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara3.jpg" alt="Mental health program at Kashmir base of MSF" width="600" height="337" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Farhat Mantoo in Kashmir</figcaption></figure>
<p>A closed door is an opportunity in disguise, something that Farhat can relate to optimistically. Wondering what to do next, she accidently met someone from the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and thus began her journey towards a new foundation in life. The humanitarian relief that the organisation provided and their Mental Health Mission in Kashmir influenced her core senses waking her up, making her staunchly believe that this is what she has to do. With a colleague who had likewise thoughts about MSF and a Brazilian psychiatrist Renato Souza working for MSF, made her resolute for working for this organisation stronger. Her multi-faceted educational background and experience boosted her work and gave her the opportunity in working in the Information Electronics and communications section of the MSF, also as a para counsellor and a Public Relations support in Kashmir. She got to serve MSF through many aspects.</p>
<p>After an errand with MSF of 3 years, she wanted to venture out as a media officer with Liverpool University. But before she could join Liverpool, she got a call from a colleague in MSF asking her to join the team again as it was planning to open its base in India for International Doctor volunteering for Human resources position. She was a little sceptical as she did not have any experience in this position before but being a go-getter she joined hands with two more teammates from Canada and Australia Kate Mort and Jeni Mastin and together they started preparing the pilot report. This was the first time that MSF had recruited from a country where they had their mission.</p>
<p>After articulating the whole plan, they finally started the base in mid-2006 with a 3 member team which has now grown into a 50 member team. They have victoriously made it a fundraising centre in India for MSF.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-12" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara-2.jpg" alt="Farhat Mantoo's Team at MSF India" width="600" height="449" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Human Resource Team at MSF India</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, she realised she needed a formal education and so completed her masters in human resource management, but being content with something superficial was not her cup of tea.  She wanted to get the real feel of how is it to stay in the thick clouds of difficulties and pain and for this she stayed in countries buried deep in hunger, diseases and malnutrition: South Sudan, Somalia and Kenya.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14" style="width: 604px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-14" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fara4.jpg" alt="Improving the health Care system in Kenya" width="604" height="453" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Farhat Mantoo: her last visit to Kenya Mission</figcaption></figure>
<p>After reiterating her stays at such atrocious places, she deliberated to herself as to why would people leave their fat paying jobs, comfortable lives and families and join hands with MSF to only work in-non-humane conditions. It can be a debacle staying in such extreme conditions, staying in places where language, food, culture is a major hindrance to the work. But that’s when the realisation dawned upon her, people come here because they are really passionate about working for the betterment of the people; they are real achievers in their respective fields of medicine; they have their thoughts aligned to the main goal like hers. Money is not what drives them but the satisfaction for doing a noble cause is what runs in their blood.</p>
<p>Even after so many years, each assignment is like a new challenge for her, something that keeps her awake in the most sleep state. Her whole life revolves around MSF. She gets the privilege to attend the various conferences held across the various parts of the world. The experience that she gets while working with dedicated patrons and professional doctors is really enriching and motivating. She feels happy to be a part of the highly passionate team of doctors, support staff, operation staff and HR professionals who hold foreign degrees, all working towards the main mission.</p>
<p>MSF has given her the freedom to work independently for the people who reside so close to her heart. Never expected anything in return but got a lot back in the most invaluable way. Nothing can replace the elation felt while meeting the elite people from IBM, ING, Netherlands police, services from different nationalities and realising that it’s not rules but the work and the humanitarian ethics that bring them together and work as a team. It has also taught her to how to provide equal opportunities to all and how to allow the members to make mistakes and allow them to cultivate into better humans. It has given her the platform to learn how to treat every human with the same dignity and respect.</p>
