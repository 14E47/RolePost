				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, we are going to take a sneak peek at the career journey of Nandini Borkar. Nandini works as an HR professional at GoZoop, Mumbai. GoZoop is a leading digital services and products company.</p>
<p>Nandini’s career journey started when she finished her Masters degree in Chemistry, in 2004. She was a bright and cheerful student since her school days. The first break which Nandini got after her Masters was at a U.K. based call center. She worked in night shifts during that tenure.</p>
<p>Soon after that Nandini got married and left this job, as it was becoming difficult for her to manage shifts after her marriage. She then struggled to get a job as a Career Counselor for some time and then moved towards sales profile for the next three years. She also took a sabbatical during her maternity break.</p>
<p>Once Nandini was ready to face back career challenges, she joined a BPO in training profile as an Associate Trainer. During these days, Nandini had an inclination towards the blooming field of Social media marketing and wanted to try her hands on it. She was also interviewed for marketing profile at GoZoop; the Mumbai-based digital services company, but ended up getting selected for HR profile there.</p>
<p>Human Resources at GoZoop are termed as Happiness officers, and so was Nandini. She has been working as a Happiness officer for the last 2.5 years in the organization. As the name suggests the Happiness officers are responsible for making all employees happy and also to make them stay longer. Nandini has been working hard towards this goal. For her, there is nothing more rewarding than sincerity and hard work, but she also knows how to work smart.</p>
<p>Being the kind of perfectionist Nandini is, she makes sure she handles all the tasks meant for her with great excitement and executes them with great spirits. She is also involved with the learning and development part of the team and the onboarding of employees.</p>

<p>As per her hobbies, she likes meeting new people, trying innovations, and traveling. Nandini is also a big time multitasked member of the team. She can handle various responsibilities simultaneously. In spare time, she likes watching movies and tries her hands on origami. On the family front, Nandini is blessed with a cute 7-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Nandini says,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am always open to learn new things. At work, I learn from the upcoming talents, and at home, my daughter is there to teach me new things each day!</p></blockquote>
<p>Nandini is a cheerful bright lady who takes every challenge and opportunity with great stride and also knows how to stay happy, always!</p>
