		<description><![CDATA[“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.” Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Self Evaluation is a key to make challenging time, pave the way to what you really want.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Varun Ranjan, a graduate from Delhi College of Engineering, was an exceptional student all his life and soon after graduation joined an IT firm working in financial domain. Always focussed on his career he worked with the company for nearly 2 years, but due to the economic slowdown, the work also slowed down and Varun had to be on &#8216;bench&#8217; for some time.  Just at the beginning of his career, he was full of enthusiasm and wanted to make a dent. But, this dampened his ambitions and also gave him time to re-evaluate what he really wants to do.</p>
<p>Being an athlete at the national level in his schooling days, he always wanted to work in sports. Sports did not look like a viable career option and thus like all his peers he also did his engineering, to save guard his career. This discontent from his job made him venture into the field he really wanted and he against all odds he did his masters from Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration &amp; Technology from Geneva.</p>
<p>As he rightly says</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are always getting prepared to can take that Plunge”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was able to convince family and friends and embarked on a journey of sports management.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-34" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varun-In-Moscow.jpg" alt="Varun with the Team " width="960" height="720" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Travelling Across Europe</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has worked for 5 years in different domains of sports management across Europe. Being a part of the International Olympics Committee was like a childhood dream come true for him. Working as a Project officer at International Olympics Committee, he got exposure to multiple sports and understood the market potential of every sport. With a desire to build a property from the ground up, he joined AIBA (International Boxing Association). Even though he has not boxed ever in his life, he found this challenge extremely interesting and he helped develop boxing in multiple countries.</p>
<p>On asking him about the potential of sports Industry in India, he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Absolutely it is. Sports industry in India has grown exponentially over the last 5-6 years and it has no signs of stopping. There are more and more jobs coming in this space and what is also heartening to see is that people are starting their own ventures in the sports space”.</p></blockquote>
<p>He feels this is the right time to invest in Indian Sports Industry and is keen to work in India in near future.</p>

<p>Varun is looking forward to FIFA U-17 World Cup coming to India and thinks of it as the biggest sporting events to happen in India. He comments</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a big event happening in India in 2017 but unfortunately many people don’t know about it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And he hopes to be a part of it. Wishing the best to Varun and hoping Indian Sports Industry can boom and many people can get involved in their dream jobs in India.</p>
