				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Your desire to learn can lead you to achieve, what others think is impossible. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Born to farmer family, living in a small village in Madhya Pradesh, Vinay could have never imagined in his childhood that we will in future become an inspiration for many in his village.</p>
<p>Vinay Khare was bought up in a small village Akola in Datiya District. The village had very limited resources and most families were engaged in farming. His primary schooling happened in a school in Akola, but his father used to teach him at home. This helped him prepare for the district level exams and got selected in the District Government School. He had secured 3<sup>rd</sup> rank overall in the Tehsil and was able to fulfil his aspirations for higher education.</p>
<p>The 5km one way walk every day to the school and being a part of new school both made his vision even more focussed on higher education. The biggest challenge he recalls is that children at that time were more afraid of schools and the hard work required he, on the other hand, got motivated by the challenges.</p>

<p>After completing the secondary education till the eighth standard, he had to move to the city Datiya for higher education and gave another entrance for “Saraswati Vidya Mandir, Datiya”. He secured his admission in the school and completed his schooling from this school. He was amongst the bright students and was always amongst the top ranking students.</p>
<p>The biggest glitch in his education so far was that he had always been in a Hindi Medium School and now for higher education English was a must. Through the AIEEE entrance examination, he got admission in Bansal College of Engineering, Mandideep (Bhopal), but the first year was very difficult as most of books and literature was in English. He had to struggle for an entire year to understand the language but his focus made him fight all odds and within the next year, he was back as the top scorer. In the Third year, the biggest opportunity came to his college as Infosys had come for placement. Infosys had a very stringent process of recruitment and he went through multiple interview process. He was academically very strong but with limited command on English, he gave his interview in part Hindi and part English.</p>
<p>But language could not stop his dreams from coming true as he got selected to Infosys, being the only student in his college to get a placement with Infosys. This lead to a new life, and he during his Infosys Training excelled in all tests and also enhanced his English in the process.  After getting his job confirmed in Pune, he was highly content with his life and became an inspiration for a lot of youngsters in his village.</p>

<p>The people who first reach the summit always leave a track for others to follow. Vinay wanted to help people and help every child to fulfil his dream for education. With this in his mind, he joined a Non –Profit called <a href="http://www.snehfoundationindia.org/" target="_blank">SNEH Foundation</a>. He got associated in Dec 2011, the major purpose of his involvement was to make parents understand how education can help make kids support families financially and also help create a better live standards for the child. He has in these 4 years of work with SNEH Foundation has changed and impacted 1000+ people lives and will in future help many become like Vinay Khare and help inspire others.</p>
