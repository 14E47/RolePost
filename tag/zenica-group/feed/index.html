<p>Our teenage days are full of dreams and in the race of life, we tend to forget them and choose a conventional career path. There are only a few who start living their dreams since their childhood. Priyanka Aggarwal had always imagined herself flying to exotic locations and started working her way towards her dream in her school days.</p>
<p>With her father in the merchant navy, she got fascinated to international travel and understanding different cultures. She started working as a promoter in her school days and after her first year of college at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce; she joined an air hostess training school. Even before her graduation, she was offered a chance to fly with a leading airline. After flying with domestic carriers, she was within 2 years promoted to as an instructor. This was a great learning for Priyanka Aggarwal and also opened a new door of opportunity.</p>
<p>After getting an offer from Charter Airlines, she joined the services and was able to fulfil her childhood dream of flying across the world. In this journey, she had an opportunity to work for dignitaries of highest order, actors, and politicians. The life was not easy as she was travelling for days in continuity, from one continent to another but she enjoyed every bit of her work.</p>
<p>The best thing which she maintained all her life was to stay grounded and learn from every experience.</p>
<p>In 2011, after a 7-year long career as a flight attendant she wanted to explore something new and was tired of the harsh schedule in flying. This meant to explore a completely new territory. She joined the hospitality industry with &#8216;SamhiÂ Group&#8217; and very well adapted to her new role as an Admin Coordinator. She found a great similarity in two industries and soon was offered to join in as Executive Assistant to the MD at Great India Nautanki Company. With the biggest entertainment destination &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221;, Multiple Restaurants and Hotels under their stable, she got exposure to management of these properties. She handled multiple projects like bringing the First Reverse Bungee to India, opening a speciality restaurant in Bangalore and managing the PNL for Kingdom Of Dreams and Galaxy.</p>
<p>With her interest in Sales and Marketing, she joined Zenica Group as an executive assistant to the Sales and Marketing Head. Zenica Group is amongst the biggest dealerships for Porsche and Audi in India and also owns multiple Apple Reseller Stores. Priyanka understood the nuances of the business and how to manage a team to get sustained growth. This experience transformed her as a professional and made her realise the difference she can make to any business.</p>

<p>With a focus to transform the business practices at her previous organisation, she joined &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; again but this time, she was leading alliances. She in this last stint has been able to build the complete hotel division at &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; and is now working to build synergies with Event Management Companies to make KOD, the number one destination for mega events.</p>
<p>Her perseverance and hunger to learn are infectious and we at RolePost wish the best for her future.</p>
