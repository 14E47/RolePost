		<description><![CDATA[She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foundation of what you will be is marked in your childhood.  Having her roots in Uttaranchal, Ruchi Pant did most o her schooling from Meerut. But thanks to her father’s transferable job she had to relocate across the country and living in multiple cities made her curious about culture and people.</p>
<p>She was a keen observer and soaked in the wisdom from the diverse experiences in her childhood. After her schooling, she did her graduation in Hospitality Management from IHM, Jaipur.  She was amongst the brightest students but she recalls herself being shy and being uncomfortable in front of new people when she started her career.</p>
<p>Well, if someone meets her now she will come across as the most pleasing personality but she says that sales industry brought about this change in her. Soon after graduation, as she joined as a sales coordinator in the hotel in Mumbai, she started interacting with a lot of people and also started building an ability to understand them. This made her very confident and she started liking interacting with anyone without any jitters.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When you fight your fundamental challenges, you get to a new level” exclaims Ruchi.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early days of her work, she built in a habit of overachieving. This used to always challenge herself and try and exceed the set target. In the beginning as a sales coordinator, she was mostly taking care of passive sales for banquet enquiries. She was looking for a more challenging work and she started working in room sales which are primarily active sales. This made her learn to identify the market, then create a need for her product and finally convert into sales.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in every assignment, she moved from low engagement products like room to selling aircraft which would make her convince the other side of the spectrum i.e. big business owners, decision makers. She loves being in this premium segment where client needs are of utmost importance. She felt a great comfort in discussing business with the biggest of dignitaries, Businessmen or even Honchos of top companies. The granularity of decision making involved and the process of conversion has always excited her.</p>
<figure id="attachment_87" style="width: 960px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-87" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ruchi-with-vijay-mallaya.jpg" alt="Ruchi has extablished business relationships with top executives across industries" width="960" height="637" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ruchi Pant with Vijay Mallaya</figcaption></figure>
<p>After working the luxury segment for more than 8 years, she wanted a new challenge. This time was to complete the diverse cycle of sales. In 2013, she started working at pathways and she realised a new dimension to sales.  This time, it was not just about convincing one party to buy a product or service, it was about making a two-way connect.</p>
<p>Pathways follow a pattern of experimental learning where children are provided with best tools to shape a great career. The School believes that children learn more from each other than from the formal education. This makes the process very intricate as it’s not just the parents selecting the school but also the school considering them to be a part of pathway family. The process of admission and communication is more counselling than selling and you need to understand the needs of the parents. In this process, you need to be extra sensitive in creating a proposition in which both the parents and the school see a value that will shape a child’s future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Consultation based selling you need to talk less and let others talk“ Ruchi Pant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Journey of Ruchi can inspire every professional in how you can develop into</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting very early as a flight attendant and travelling across the world, has given Priyanka wings to succeed in every assignment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_92" style="width: 400px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-92" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Priyanka-Bhakoo-1.jpg" alt="Priyanka Bhakoo professional image" width="400" height="400" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Priyanka Bhakoo as a professional at Samhi Group</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our teenage days are full of dreams and in the race of life, we tend to forget them and choose a conventional career path. There are only a few who start living their dreams since their childhood. Priyanka Aggarwal had always imagined herself flying to exotic locations and started working her way towards her dream in her school days.</p>
<p>With her father in the merchant navy, she got fascinated to international travel and understanding different cultures. She started working as a promoter in her school days and after her first year of college at Delhi College of Arts and Commerce; she joined an air hostess training school. Even before her graduation, she was offered a chance to fly with a leading airline. After flying with domestic carriers, she was within 2 years promoted to as an instructor. This was a great learning for Priyanka Aggarwal and also opened a new door of opportunity.</p>
<p>After getting an offer from Charter Airlines, she joined the services and was able to fulfil her childhood dream of flying across the world. In this journey, she had an opportunity to work for dignitaries of highest order, actors, and politicians. The life was not easy as she was travelling for days in continuity, from one continent to another but she enjoyed every bit of her work.</p>
<p>The best thing which she maintained all her life was to stay grounded and learn from every experience.</p>
<p>In 2011, after a 7-year long career as a flight attendant she wanted to explore something new and was tired of the harsh schedule in flying. This meant to explore a completely new territory. She joined the hospitality industry with &#8216;Samhi Group&#8217; and very well adapted to her new role as an Admin Coordinator. She found a great similarity in two industries and soon was offered to join in as Executive Assistant to the MD at Great India Nautanki Company. With the biggest entertainment destination &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221;, Multiple Restaurants and Hotels under their stable, she got exposure to management of these properties. She handled multiple projects like bringing the First Reverse Bungee to India, opening a speciality restaurant in Bangalore and managing the PNL for Kingdom Of Dreams and Galaxy.</p>
<p>With her interest in Sales and Marketing, she joined Zenica Group as an executive assistant to the Sales and Marketing Head. Zenica Group is amongst the biggest dealerships for Porsche and Audi in India and also owns multiple Apple Reseller Stores. Priyanka understood the nuances of the business and how to manage a team to get sustained growth. This experience transformed her as a professional and made her realise the difference she can make to any business.</p>

<p>With a focus to transform the business practices at her previous organisation, she joined &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; again but this time, she was leading alliances. She in this last stint has been able to build the complete hotel division at &#8220;Kingdom Of Dreams&#8221; and is now working to build synergies with Event Management Companies to make KOD, the number one destination for mega events.</p>
<p>Her perseverance and hunger to learn are infectious and we at RolePost wish the best for her future.</p>
