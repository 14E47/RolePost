				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Talent is the light for the World, the onus is on torchbearer.”</p>
<p>People Management is one thing that intrigues a lot of us, but Micky Chopra is the right person if you really want to understand the nuances of this skill. He has built a career in Human Resource management but this was not his natural instinct when he was in his college.</p>
<p>Micky started his professional career with Indian Navy Services, after completing his MCA from Galgotia College (Lucknow University). The technical knowledge he received in the college came in handy for understanding client requirements and this helped him move to FCS Software. While working as the resource manager at FCS, he was able to understand how it is important to be able to manage people to improve processes.</p>
<p>The journey towards Human Resource was a slow and steady transformation, where he with his goal oriented focus was able to carve his way to becoming a talent specialist. His first break in Talent management was with SAVY Infotech as the Country Manager in Talent Acquisition and Client Delivery.  Talent Acquisition was an exciting domain for him but his desire to dwell deeper into the realms of people management made him see beyond talent acquisition.</p>

<p>For last three years, he working with OSS cube and then Taction Software LLC has taken a strategic role, where he understand that talent acquisition is just the start of the cycle and you need to look deeper to sustain the bottom line. He acknowledges how retention and talent engagement can lead to a sustained growth of an organisation.  He approaches human resources in a very technical way and attributes his success to his technical understanding, which has helped him build his career.</p>
<p>The way HR has changed with time is phenomenal,   from being a backend role it has today become a strategy based position with multiple elements like talent branding, talent satisfaction, talent performance and business acquisition through talent being the key matrices today. As Taction Software deals in Niche Technologies, the task becomes more challenging and Talent Branding plays a very important role in acquiring the right talent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 1024px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-114" src="http://rolepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MICky-Chopra-Award2-.jpeg" alt="Hr Tech Influence award" width="1024" height="682" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Micky is among-st the top 50 HR Tech Influencers</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest motivators for Micky have been his family who supported this tough decision of moving from the more lucrative technology domain to people management.  Today, he is amongst the top 50 HR Technical leaders in the country and a very active speaker about technology in HR. He also promotes sports in his work sphere and at Oss cube was the president of the sports initiative and helped build a culture for sports. This he adds also helps build better work ethics.</p>
<p>“The intent of Rolepost is great, and will help bring the community together and this will be also a great way to appreciate the real talent”</p>
